1	"Gentlemen:

 Attached is the DASH for the approval of the DPR Accelerated Put 
transaction.  This partial divestiture allows us to put $11 million of our 
equity interest back to DPR Holding Company, LLC and its subsidiary, Dakota, 
LLC.  Both entities are controlled by Chris Cline.

 In addition to redeeming part of our equity interest, the deal provides us 
900,000 tons of coal priced below market, an option which could lead to a 
very profitable synfuel project, and the potential for more marketing fees 
from other Cline entities.

 The DASH has been approved and signed by RAC and JEDI II, and is now 
awaiting Mark Haedicke's review and approval.  I wanted to give you the 
opportunity to review the DASH and become familiar with the provisions of the 
deal.

 If you have any questions on the transaction, feel free to contact me at 
(412) 490-9048.  Others familiar with the deal are Mike Beyer, George 
McClellan, and Wayne Gresham.

 Thank you.

Subject: Re: Trip to San Diego

My thoughts for the trip:

Friday:

Everyone says that you have to see the zoo if you are in San Diego.  Even- if 
you don't particularly like zoos.  Everything I read says that it will take 
at least half a day.  I say we hit that Friday morning through early 
afternoon.  Spend mid-afternoon near the hotel- beach area- suppose to be 
shopping, etc. near there.  Then go to the game.  When we get back that 
night- we can walk on the beach!

Saturday:

Visit Balboa Park.  See the Botanical Gardens, in other musuems/gardens in 
the area that look interesting.  If we aren't sick of seeing animals, there 
is suppose to be a wonderful Wild Animal Park that gives trolley or walking 
tours (the tours are only like an hour and a half).  After that- there is a 
ferry you can take across the bay to the Coronado Island to see the Hotel del 
Coronado.  It is suppose to be a really neat place.  Then- you we can finish 
the day in the Gaslamp Quarter downtown.  It is suppose to have a ""lively 
evening street scene"" and live music.

What do you think?  Let me know- so I can look up times that all of these 
open- if we are interested.

Subject: 1999 NNG & TW Audited Financial Statements

Heather Mueck (AA) advised me this morning that in spite of our recent letter 
order from the FAO by Jim Guest, AA still does not believe we have enough 
evidence (other than our own opinion) to justify regulatory asset treatment 
for the Y2K costs.  While this position is consistent with what they had told 
us before we made the filing, they had given us no clue last week when they 
were providing their comments on our browncover drafts that they still had a 
problem with the Y2K assets--even when they were relaying Roger Willard's 
comments.

The bottom line is that they will have a PAJE on Northern for the amount of 
the asset  (aproximately $3.6MM), but the amount on TW (less than $.5MM) is 
so small they will pass on it.  As I understand it, that won't preclude a 
clean opinion on NNG this year, but the PAJE will continue in future years' 
audits until the asset is approved for recovery in Northern's next general 
rate case.  Therefore, if we have additional Northern PAJE's in future years, 
the combined effect would be used to determine whether or not a clean opinion 
would be appropriate in those years.

I assume we will suffer the scarlet letter of the multi-year PAJE, rather 
than write off the reg asset in the 1999 Brown Cover and be required to flow 
the write-off through consolidated earnings (and internal scorekeeping) in 
the year 2000."	violation detected	This message contains proprietary business information, including financial details, regulatory asset treatment, and internal scorekeeping, which should not be publicly disclosed.

19	"Frank:
I spoke with her attorney yesterday and believe that I addressed her concerns 
with the ETA, GTC and Password Application forms.  She is going to add 
language to the Password Application that makes it clear that any GTC is 
considered to be ""signed"" and ""in writing"" if they are required by the 
Website to click on it.  Her main concern given the fact that we now have a 
Master in place with them is that they are not asked to accept the terms of a 
GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers 
the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a 
GTC.  Anyway, putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel 
better.  Once you receive the PA from her why don't you fax it to me  and I 
will let you know if it is acceptable.

Also, as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday, they wanted to do a ""test"" run 
on the Website to check to make sure that they would not be asked to accept a 
GTC.  I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product 
description once they get their password.  I understand that you and Tana 
will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the 
ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper time 
so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC appears.

I am a YPOer in the Rebel Chapter who was given your name from an IOS source
as someone who could potentially help in this situation. As background, I
sent this IOS request out last week:

Description of Situation
My highway construction company has been negatively impacted by price
volatility in energy prices (fuel, natural gas, and asphalt cement). We
offer long term, fixed price contracts to our clients yet must purchase our
petroleum and energy-related products at spot market prices. Thus we are
exposed to significant price adjustment risks.

Type of Feedback Requested:
Does anyone have experience using commodity contracts as an arbitrage
strategy to offset the risks of potential price volatility in the energy
sector? If so, do you have specific recommendations for how we should
proceed?

Thank you for any information you can offer.

As I have investigated this further, I find no one in this industry (highway
construction) who is purchasing futures to mitigate their energy cost
exposure. I have spoken with folks who are doing this in the building supply
sector with lumber futures.

Do you have any thoughts or suggestions in this matter? Any input would be
greatly appreciated.

the way we articulate the relative liquidity of our positions to banks and 
ratings agencies.  De facto, we will be saying that our balance sheet and 
income statement reflect an ability to liquidate gas and power in North 
America at the mid with no adverse effects.  While this may be true, 
typically these types of institutions see the result of liquidating much more 
liquid portfolios, i.e., they will not believe that we have perfect 
liquidity.  I believe that we can satisfy both accounting and credit 
considerations if we maintain an ability to calculate an ""orderly 
liquidation"" under a negative pricing scenario (basically, multiple horizon 
VAR against a liquidating position).  This is what we showed Moody's last 
month.  The main difference is that the resulting number will be a hit to p&l 
as opposed to having reserves against it.  This is a long way of saying that 
I think it would be a good idea to discuss prudency methodology with both RAC 
and Treasury once you have finalized a course of action.

Subject:	New Options Model

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and will eventually have them on a daily basis.

57	"Attention: Houston-based Outlook Users
The Global Messaging Team is proud to announce that beginning today, Monday July 16th, Houston-based Enron employees that have been migrated to Outlook will be able to securely access their Enron Email from anywhere on the web. This means that if you can get on to the Internet, you can access your Enron Email with Outlook Web Access (OWA) without having to dial in to Enron's network. Please note that this is not available to those users still on Lotus Notes but will be available once they are migrated to Outlook. 
Once on the Internet, type mail.enron.com in your browser address window and supply your Enron network logon credentials as username and password. For example:
Username: jdoe4
Password: ********
Once you log in, Outlook Web Access opens your Enron Email mailbox. Outlook Web Access (OWA) allows you to send and receive mail, perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts, as well as access your mailbox folders. At this time, Public Folders are not accessible via OWA.  Please keep in mind that Outlook Web Access is a browser-based version of what you might use in the office, so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of Outlook 2000 may not be available at all. Additionally, OWA is only supported using Internet Explorer 5.x only and not supported with Netscape.
Outlook Web Access is the standard Email package for connecting to your Enron mail from home, whether you are using an Enron-issued home PC, an Internet connection with your personal home PC, or your ClickAtHome PC. We will not support the use of the full Outlook installation for home use.
Outlook Web Access for remote locations and European/APAC Enron sites is currently being addressed and will be available soon. At this time, OWA is only available if your mailbox resides on a Houston mail server.

  Worker Dead at Desk For 5 Days

     Bosses of a publishing firm are trying to work out why no one noticed
  that one of their employees had been sitting dead at his desk for FIVE
DAYS before anyone asked if he was feeling okay.

     George Turklebaum, 51, who had been employed as a proof-reader at a New
  York firm for 30 years, had a heart attack in the open-plan office he
  shared with 23 other workers. He quietly passed away on Monday, but nobody
  noticed until Saturday morning when an office cleaner asked why he was
  still working during the weekend.

      His boss Elliot Wachiaski said ""George was always the first guy in
each morning and the last to leave at night, so no one found it unusual that
  he was in the same position all that time and didn't say anything. He was
  always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself.""

      A post mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five days
  after suffering a coronary. Ironically, George was proofreading
  manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died."	violation detected	This text contains explicit sensitive information about a deceased individual, including their name, age, occupation, cause of death, and details about their work habits.

Subject: Team Project #2---Problem #2



I think Dennis, Shawne and I were supposed to work more on #2, but since I
can't recall, I'm sending to all.

First, I apologize.  I tried to work directly with the excellent
spreadsheet Carolyn put together, but I kept fumbling, butchering, etc.  So
I canibalized her great stuff and created a new spreadsheet, attempting to
incorporate the ""clarifications"" (yeah, right) that Prof McCullough
distributed via email, and the stuff we talked about during break (i.e.,
timing of cash flows).  The answers are at the bottom of the work sheet.
And I've also included the report (though I did not peruse it for errors,
relevancy, etc.).

My  biggest concern is question 6.  My answer (despite some outliers) sez
that there ain't no loan in June.  (This may mean my spreadsheet's got a
fatal flaw--significant probability.)

Finally, doing a series of 1,000 trials resulted in some considerable
variability across runs--again, could be due to screw up on my part--so the
answers I generatd comes from a run of 5,000 trials.  (If you run the
sheet, beware, 5,000 takes some time, unless you've got DSL or something.)

Let me know if this is completely out to lunch, or if you're coming up with
something remotely similar.

Best,
Jeff

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Christopher Duran"	violation detected	This text contains explicit personal information such as full name, mailing address, and email address, as well as financial information related to Enron stock transactions and allegations of underhanded dealings, all of which can lead to privacy risks and potential misuse.

Authorize the Treasurer to issue debt, backed by ratepayers, to cover any

chose BK Court b/c concluded that BK venue was better than continuing in 
State political process - the decision was made after listening to Gov's 
speech last night and concluding that were getting only words, not actions.  
No face-to-face meetings for over 3 weeks.  Negotiations ""going nowhere"" and 
state has ""broken promises."" Gov's negotiators said they wanted to deal w/ 
SCE before resuming talks w/ PG&E.  The BK court is the fairest venue to 
ensure that all creditors are treated fairly, will stabilize situation, and 
best way to deal w/ power crisis. 

notified State of impending crisis last summer - negotiations have been 
ongoing since November

Reasons for filing:  current rates not covering full net open position -  
un-reimbursed wholesale power costs to ISO grown to $300 million/month; PUC 
order obligates then to pay full QF costs but rates insufficient by $100 
million/month; CDWR-related costs not quantified yet; mentioned ""illegal 
accounting procedures"" ordered b y the PUC.

District Court case on filed rate arguments will go forward - believe they 
will win and that all creditors will be paid.

Recent rate hikes ordered by CPUC will go into effect but BK court will have 
to decide where the $$ goes.  CPUC and BK ""will probably have some 
interesting conversations"" about authority to set rates.

114	"Talked to Dave.  In a nut shell, here are the problem areas in the bill as he 
sees it.  It was a very brief conversation, but I think I've captured the key 
points:
Based on an expectation that the ""expedited siting"" bill would help site 
plants, Dave's group had six plants on the drawing board.

The 5 ppm requirement kills 4 of the 6, i.e., the 4 can't meet the 5 ppm 
requirement.
The requirement that the plants would either be 1) shut down after 3 years or 
2) replaced with a combined-cycle plant kills the other 2 because a) shutting 
down the plants in 3 years kills the economics, and b) the sites for the two 
LM-6000s can't accomodate combined cylces (i.e., Dave couldn't get siting).
In addition,the generator would be required to sign an exclusive with the ISO 
(which the EOB would have to approve), which takes away the optionality of 
going to the market, thus killing the economics.
On the labor side, it's complicated, but in essence, by requiring that ""...it 
be shown that the applicant has a contract with a general contractor and has 
contracted for an adequate supply of skilled labor to construct, operate, and 
maintain the plant,"" 
it forces Dave to negotiate a labor deal before he knows what the project is 
(i.e, before the project has been approved), and,
it effectively prevents Enron from having the option to use internal 
resources (this issue is very specific to Enron; I can explain more if folks 
prefer).

In short, bullets 1-3 would seem to affect both Enron and the market, while 
the last bullet is, according to Dave, very Enron specific.  Point 2 in 
bullet 4, according to Dave is sensitive and should not be made public.

If any questions, let me know.  Bruno has emailed the price cap and the 
""general-funds-to-help-finance-the-cap"" bills, and faxed the siting bill.

Best,
Jeff"	violation detected	The text contains proprietary business information, including details about specific projects, economic impacts, labor negotiations, and sensitive business strategies.

ISO Board agrees that such a proposal is desirable and should be put in place 
this summer, but finds fault with some of the provisions and omissions from 
the MC approved proposal. The Board directs its staff to begin to develop 
tariff provisions to implement a modified program to be filed with FERC as 
soon as possible after receipt from FERC of its decision on the proposed 
circuit breaker (now referred to as the automated mitigation procedures or 
AMP). Since a circuit breaker proposal will be voted on by the MC on May 23, 
even if passed and immediately filed with FERC, a decision regarding the 
circuit breaker is not likely to be forthcoming until July under even an 
expedited schedule. We will continue to work with other suppliers in opposing 
this program.

Good afternoon John,

I hope things are well with you.  I am writing to update you on the status of 
your meetings with Andy Fastow, Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling.  I have arranged 
the following meeting dates and times with Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling, (I am 
still trying to work with Andy Fastow's schedule):

Jeff Skilling
December 4th  
2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Ken Lay
December 4th
3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Also, I will attempt to schedule the meeting with Andy Fastow for December 
4th for convenience - this will also allow us to possibly schedule additional 
meetings for the 5th (as needed).  I will let you know as soon as I'm 
successful.

Subject: My resume



Vasant,

I enjoyed our telephone conversation this morning.  From our conversation,
it sounds like Enron is moving out on the cutting edge of risk transfer and
insurance finance.  In my mind, there seem to be a myriad number of
interesting opportunities moving forward.  As well, I see a number of issues
that would need to be resolved.  Frankly, I find that quite exciting.  I
left academics largely because I wanted to move into a more ""front line""
career. While I've enjoyed my work here at the NAIC, it is still not where I
ultimately see myself.  I gathered from your comments some concern about my
being too senior in the organization.  If I am interpreting you correctly,
you are concerned about hands on technical work.  I enjoy that immensely and
some of the strengths I bring to the table are the ability to think
creatively about solving financial problems and the the ability to make data
tell the underlying story.

I look forward to talking to you next week.  I just found out that our
office building will be closed Monday, so I will not be in until Tuesday
a.m.

To All -

Just a follow-up message to each of you about the iBuyit program.  

I am still in need of a designated volunteer from each of your groups to act 
as a Change Agent for this program.  Since it is a Corp. initiative and will 
be implemented over time, I need to make sure all areas of the Legal Dept. 
are on board.  

Please provide me with the name of at least one person within your group who 
fits the Change Agent bill.  For those that have forgotten, the Change Agent 
is defined as follows:

""individuals who are highly respected within their area and known as the 'GO 
TO' people among their peers.""

Their responsibilities are:

- to disseminate communications regarding the project
- to develop awareness and ownership of the product among their department
- to encourage use of the product
- identify those who will need training
- encourage peer training attendance 
- engage in rumor control (basically relay the facts of the program and not 
the myths (e.g., the product will replace jobs))

Information needs to be distributed to these individuals as soon as possible 
so that they can be prepared for demonstrations of the iBuyit product next 
week.

Thanks for your assistance.

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Daniel Lunney"	violation detected	This text contains explicit personal information such as full name, address, and email address, as well as financial information related to Enron stock and donations, which could lead to privacy risks and potential misuse.

Attached is a summary of the Lonestar imbalance for 2001.

 

As per our earlier discussion,  I met with Dan Fancler to discuss the Lonestar oba proposal.  Dan and I would suggest that a ceiling be placed on the cummulative volume amount and that any volume over that ceiling be required to be cashed out at that month's index price.  This process would serve to limit TW's financial exposure related to the revaluation of volumetric imbalances.

Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."	violation detected	This text contains sensitive information related to professional roles and business operations, including the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer, details of his previous roles and responsibilities within the company, and the impact of his appointment on investor confidence and the company's share price.

2.  you know my outlook for xh,  with slightly above normal weather jan goes out at 2.75 and that is not constrained by a #6 floor.  next jv, too far away to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a $2.50-3.50 commodity.  
3. the obvious
4. yes.  believe if we end at 2.6 in the ground, the current nymex forward curve may be fairly priced.  my belief is that at the current prices we will end up with much more than 2.6 and that $5 is not value if we have 2.8 in the ground and gaining y on y.  circular argument that leads to my belief that prices must fall.
5.  not necessarily.  will loss of demand with normal weather cancel the fact that there will be much less demand destruction.  probably.

1- As gas plummets are you assuming that it regains all demand (industrial shutdowns and fuel switchers)?
2-What is your outlook for Nov-Mar 01 and Ap-oct 02
3- How does your view change with a normal, cold or warm winter ?
4- Is your view predicated on getting to 2.6  is easy and that world did not end this past winter a storage level of 2.6?
5- Do you believe that we will need to price some demand out again this winter?

Carol, I'd like to speak with you regarding the following structure proposed 
by Sorema, which address the fact that they can't sell/buy derivatives and 
can't reinsure any contract governed by NY law.  The credit issue 
remains--they propose solving it by means of an assignment clause.

Sorema did six deals with us last year using Palladium.

221	"The Supreme Court cleared the way yesterday for the EPA to enforce its new 
""NOx SIP Call"" regulations aimed at reducing NOx emissions in the eastern 
half of the U.S..?  The Court refused to hear an appeal by several electric 
utilities and Midwest states, which contended that the EPA had used improper 
criteria in setting the regulations.? The Supreme Court's decision lets stand 
a March 2000 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit that 
upheld the regulations.? 

This means the NOx SIP Call regulations will go into effect with an 
implementation date of May 2004.  

Under the original SIP Call regulations, 22 states (AL, CT, DE, GA, IL, IN, 
KY, MD, MA, MI, MO, NJ, NY, NC, OH, PA, RI, SC, TN, VA, WV, WI) and the 
District of Columbia were required to submit State Implementation Plans 
(SIPs) to EPA by October 31, 2000 (with a grace period until December 31, 
2000).   Some states submitted SIPs by the deadline, but many are still in 
the process of developing SIPs.  Those states that do not submit SIPs or 
whose SIPs are not approved by EPA will be subject to a fallback Federal rule 
(FIP) and lose the ability to control NOx emissions from their sources.  A 
few states were excluded from the SIP requirement as a result of the 
litigation, but those states are in the process of developing SIPs anyway.

Now that the SIP call is final, we will be back to you shortly with further 
analysis of the SIP development efforts the states and other intelligence 
about what states and sources may be doing in anticipation of the regulations.

Please call if you have any questions.

some information/data flow processes as follows:-

i) Factor Loadings for silver, gold, cocoa beans and TC (treatment charge for 
copper concentrate)
ii) Check correlations between Nickel and Alu and Nickel and Copper (I got 
different answers to Houston)
iii) Ensure latest forward price curves are included (perhaps through live 
link to Telerate/Reuters)
iiia) Price for silver is wrong (units should be $ per troy ounce), and 
similarly for gold (price should be $ per troy ounce), also we need cocoa 
bean forward curve
iv) Find a better way to extract positional information from MG Metals/link 
to the spreadsheet in an automated fashion
v) Add ""minor"" metals like cobalt, palladium, platinum, cadmium etc. (N.B. we 
have 1,093 troy ounces of palladium short posn and 3,472 troy ounces platinum

234	"Here's the proposal:

There is NO reason for the PUC to suspend DA since 1) 18XX passed--therefore the bonds are taken care of; all Davis has to do is sign the bill, 2) Angelides has said that money's not an issue, at least for the next several months, and 3) the Senate passed a resolution on Friday night stating that there is no reason to continue the ""state of emergency"" put in place by Davis on Jan. 17 and that the state of emergency should therefore end.
The PUC should therefore keep DA intact and begin putting the ratemaking in place to enable DA, while achieving other important objectives (e.g., no cost-shifting, make sure bonds get serviced, etc.)
If, however, the PUC rejects this rational, sensible proposal and decides to suspend DA, then that date must not be any earlier than Sept. 20th; and if it is, we will sue.

  Pete Van De Gohm of EES has again raised the topic of inventorying our 
trade secret protection which has been discussed from time to time.  I have 
visited with Jim Derrick about having a legal/business committee representing 
your major groups.  It would function in a similar manner as our Y2K 
committee did.  We would have Fulbright & Jaworski give our people general 
instructions, our business people would canvass our companies to determine 
what we considered proprietary trade secrets and if we were not protecting 
our proprietary information appropriately, we could address that issue.  
Fulbright could also be used on an ad hoc basis.   Costs would be shared 
proportionately between the major groups except special fees attributable to 
a specific operating group.
 
  I believe we need this inventory.  If we try to enforce our non-competition 
agreements and we can't prove that we kept such information on a need to know 
basis and properly secured, we could lose the law suit.

The gas processing plant has been shut down for many years and is in fact dismantled.  I would leave off any mention.
There is an active compressor station in fact it was converted to electric from gas in 1999.
There is still an active underground storage facility.  Capabilities have improved from what you have to the following:
	Storage Capacity: 70 BCF to 115 BCF

They are a top notch guide service out of Winnie, Texas (near Beaumont) that specialize in duck and goose hunting.  They have hunting packages around $150 a gun (they offer corporate discounts as well).  All you need is a license, shells, gun, and waders:  they will take care of the transportation (4 wheelers), guide, and dog.  

I am heading down there tomorrow for a hunt with my uncle.  I will let you know how we do.  If you are interested I can arrange hunt on a future Saturday or Sunday morning.  Regards, Lyle

Thanks for the note.  My only comment would be in relation to the resource adequacy discussion - watch this one, I believe that NERC is trying to promote a nation-wide ICAP.

It was good to see you the other day.  It's funny because I had tried to
send you an e-mail, after talking to Andrew about the paper.  It's great
eveything is going well.  I'm running the NYC Marathon in two weeks so my

group, where he was responsible for documenting the information requirements

Global, and Credit's collateral tracking systems.  Richard joined Global Data 
Management in September, 1998, as the Systems Integration Analyst, overseeing

Please take a moment to review the attached document that has been sent in
to the coordinator of the CFSA Tournament volunteers.  As you will see we
are still in need of a volunteer list from most of you.  For those of you
who have turned in your list, thank you very much, your prompt attention to
this request is greatly appreciated. I know Spring Break did not help
matters much but I need to get a completed list turned in ASAP. The longer
you wait the less of a chance you will have of getting your choice.
Remember CFSA is operated on a volunteer basis.  This means the organization
will only be as good as the people that volunteer.

287	"Please see the attached comparison of the Phase 6 that we have in the 2002-2006 Plan versus Dave's analysis.

For the Plan, we ran it with and without Phase 6 to determine the incremental change.  The worksheet attached also shows the Returns on Equity and Capitalization (with and without) based on the Plan runs.

You will have a reasonable apples-to-apples if you compare the amounts at the Operating Income level because Dave did not assume how it was financed in his analysis however my depreciation is GAAP but Dave's is Tax.

There are only two significant differences:

1)  For conservatism, Dave used the settled rate rather than the rate refund floor rate in 2004.  In Dave's calculations this made a difference of  about 2.9 cents (77.60 cts vs. 74.71 cts. ) for the customers other than FP&L in 2004.  There is no difference for FP&L because their 2004 rate cap is 74.60 cts, lower than either the settled or rate refund floor rates.  (Per Dave, in the risk analyses the rate refund floor impact WAS included.)

2)  We got a lower Ad Valorem tax estimate from Ted Ryan than what Dave used."	violation detected	This text contains proprietary business information, including detailed financial analysis and specific differences in financial assumptions and calculations between individuals.

Subject: Termination of EnronOnline Trades

Per my discussion with Mark Taylor and our conversation today, attached is 
the form of Termination Agreement that should be used when terminating 
EnronOnline mistake or ""oops"" trades.  The trades should continue to be 
initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any 
unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual 
circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk 
for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling.  These same 
procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions.

Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer 
and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company.  The Termination 
Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.

The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be 
terminated.  Reverse trades should not be entered into.

If you have any questions, please call."	violation detected	This email contains proprietary business information related to EnronOnline trades, including discussions about terminating trades, legal procedures, and specific individuals involved in the process.

305	"You asked about:  James W. Cunningham, General Manager - Bellingham 
Operations, Georgia-Pacific Corporation.  

As I understand it, GP is currently served under Schedule 48 by Puget Sound 
Energy.  
Schedule 48 prices the energy component of a customer's rate on the basis of 
an index (I can't recall if its Dow-Jones or NYMEX).  
This summer GP complained about the high prices under the rate schedule and 
accused PSE of improperly implementing the rate schedule.  
While the basic problem was the high prices resulting from application of the 
index, GP nonetheless filed a complaint against PSE at the WUTC.  

GP is advised by Robert McCullough.  Recall that McCullough has issued press 
reports indicating that the capacity shortage 
is a result more of game playing than anyting else.  

I think you can expect Cunningham to be slightly hostile (not so much to 
Enron, but rather to open markets in general)--in this regard he may be an 
advocate for WSCC-wide caps and may argue that there was gameplaying in the 
PNW (which produced high off-peak prices and and a June peak price of about 
$1500 MWh.  
Re:  Enron, Greg Wolfe tells me that ENA
mid-market made several offers through PSE and a variety of consultants to 
try and help GP.  I don't believe any of the offers were accepted.

If Cunningham is speaking for more than just GP--i.e., ICNU as a whole, we 
can expect a slightly softer approach.  Perhaps:  (1) resources are good; (2) 
a WSCC wide cap is appropraite in the near term; (3) a transition to 
restructuring  is appropriate."	violation detected	This text contains professional roles, activities, and behaviors that suggest access to confidential information, such as the mention of specific individuals, their professional roles, and their involvement in business operations and negotiations.

Chris,

   Columbia Marketing has some outstanding invoices from Jan - Mar of this 
year
for gathering and processing charges against contract 50140 IGS.  I talked 
with
Doug Kinney at CES, and he referred me to you.  Should Enron be paying these
charges?  Do you need me to send copies of the invoices to you, or do you have
an accounting contact for me?

   Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.

Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know

his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling 
this and pass the info on."	violation detected	The email contains sensitive business information, including the name and contact details of a Citibank subsidiary employee, Jerry Peskuchi, as well as details about a potential ISDA agreement.

332	"Now that two settlement proposals and a motion to extend time have been 
filed, there is no telling what the CPUC will do.  My recommendation is that 
we play it safe and assume we will need to file testimony on April 17.  To 
that end, it's time to review some basics.

In its July 8, 1999 decision, the Commission stated:  ""We see reason to 
pursue a change in protocol for receiving gas at Hector Road, even in the 
short term.  If there are burdens that would unfairly fall upon Transwestern 
customers is a window was established at Hector Road, we want to hear about 
it in the next phase of the proceeding.  In addition, we seek specific 
proposals as to how such an arrangement should be defined.""

Accordingly, the testimony we file should explain:

1.  The unfair harm that could potentially befall TW customers if Hector Road 
were established as a formal receipt point
2.   Our proposal for making Hector a formal receipt point by establishing 
primary and secondary receipt points
3.  Why our proposal is fair and consistent with Commission policy (here we 
might want to draw analogies to the interstate system and explain why that 
works)

I will also have an opportunity to make legal and policy arguments in a brief 
after testimony has been filed.

Let's discuss how best to go about drafting the testimony.  I think the best 
thing to do would be to outline the testimony, then decide who is going to 
say what.  I'm available after about 2:00 today."	no violation detected

Remediation efforts to remove PSH have gone well recently and it is now time 
to focus more attention toward remediation of the dissolved phase plume. This 
is reflected in the proposed scope.

Two files are attached. The first file includes a project scope and cost 
estimate for 2001. The second file contains photos of the site. 

The cost estimate is $93,000. This figure includes only contract installation 
dollars, so the work order amount would be about 20-30% more than this. The 
bulk of this figure ($53,000) is for system modifications to focus more 
attention toward remediation of the dissolved phase plume. 

If you get a chance to look at the photos, be sure to look at the last photo. 
This photo shows the interior of the SVE knockout box that was installed in 
Dec 1999 in the NE pit area. This installation has worked very well over the

I just talked with Kenneth Kohut and Bob Zarik of FERC (with Scott Miller's group).  They want to track Enron's EnronOnline pricing for these PHYSICAL products:

Gas
-Transco Zone 6 NY
-Henry Hub
-Chicago City Gate 
-Malin
-El Paso Non-bondad
-Permian Basin

Power
-Palo Verde 
-COB
-Mid C
-Cinergy
-PJM West

They would like us to tell them the best physical product to follow in gas (ie, gas daily, etc.) and want something that has Dec 01 pricing.  They also want EnronOnline end of day bid prices historically since August 01.  They then want to follow the pricing on EnronOnline themselves.

They already have access to most of this data through EnronOnline; however, the EnronOnline help desk told them that EnronOnline itself does not have historical data.  

I'll check with gas guys and see if we can get the data and report back to you.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Susannah dakin"	violation detected	This text contains explicit personal information such as full name, mailing address, and email address, as well as financial information related to Enron stock transactions and donations, which can lead to privacy risks and potential misuse.

 Kenneth L. Lay   Enron Corp.   Chairman and CEO

Pending confirmation
 Douglas A. Warner III  J.P. Morgan   Chairman

According to Federico, if there is any late cancellation, no one will be 
substituted. Also, there is a small possibility that
the dinner could take place in Washington, rather than N.Y., based on Fox's

working on the final agenda.

Cavemates.

From: Bin Laden, Osama 

Sent: Monday, December 10, 2001 8:17 AM 

Subject: The Cave 

Hi guys. We've all been putting in long hours in this conflict but we've
finally come together as a group and I love that. Big thanks to Omar for
putting up the poster that says ""There is no I in team"" as well as the one
that says ""Hang In There, Baby."" That cat is hilarious. However, while we
are fighting a jihad, we can't forget to take care of the cave. And frankly
I have a few concerns. 
First of all, while it's good to be concerned about cruise missiles, we
should be even more concerned about the scorpions in our cave. Hey, you
don't want to be stung and neither do I, so we need to sweep the cave daily.

I've posted a sign-up sheet near the main cave opening. 
Second, it's not often I make a video address but when I do, I'm trying to
scare the most powerful country on earth, okay? That means that while we're
taping, please do not ride your razor scooter in the background. Just while
we're taping. Thanks. 
Third point, and this is a touchy one. As you know, by edict, we're not
supposed to shave our beards. But I need everyone to just think hygiene,
especially after mealtime. We're all in this together. 
Fourth: food. I bought a box of Cheez-Its recently, clearly wrote ""Osama"" on
the front, and put it on the top shelf. Today, my Cheez-Its were gone.
Consideration. That's all I'm saying. 
Finally, we've heard that there may be American soldiers in disguise trying
to infiltrate our ranks. I want to set up patrols to look for them. First
patrol will be Omar, Muhammed, Abdul, Akbar, and the new guy Richard. 

Love you lots.

I was going to write that the buying and selling of physical commodity 
locally was OK, but that hedging had to be done with Regional Hub. The 
problem with this model is that it describes Helsinki before the bust!

Another possiblity is the agency model, where the local trader acts under the 
direction of the hub trader. This is where Helsinki currently is (although we 
also have an independent manager on site). However, I am not so happy with 
this, and Rick Causey certainly does not like it. Perhaps we should recommend 
independent Risk Managers in every office, but all correspondence and 
settlement with regional hub?"	no violation detected

I thought that it would be easier to e-mail you since we keep missing each 
other on the phone.  All of the St. Clair's are doing well.  Charles keeps 
growing.  At his last visit last week he was 11 1/2 pounds and 22 inches.  
Needless to say he likes to eat.  He is gradually starting to sleep more at 
night but is still pretty unpredictable and I've just gotten used to not 
getting alot of sleep.  Having Bill home with me is a big help and it makes 
it alot easier for me since we can trade off.

Physically, I am feeling almost 100%.  I started running a few weeks ago just 
to keep my sanity and have started playing tennis again although it is going 
to take a long time for me to get back into playing shape.  Arthur is very 
much into tennis and I am enjoying getting to watch him play.  He played in 
his first tournament over the weekend and did very well.  Bill and I are 
hoping that he keeps it up.  He has been great with the baby as I expected.  
He is a calming influence on him and really interacts well with him.  I feel 
very, very fortunate.

How are you doing and how are the boys?  I miss work and the interaction with 
everyone, but at the same time I am enjoying my time at home.  I think that 
you know how I must feel and I'm glad that I still have some time to think 
about it.  I can't imagine having to go back after 6 weeks as I am just 
beginning to feel good physically.  Carol St. Clair

Arthur is back in school and is a big help at home.  I'm enjoying being home 
with him when he gets home from school and its nice to be able to visit him 
while he is in school.

I hope that you are doing well and not killing yourself up there.  How are 
your parents doing?  Please give them my best.  I keep promising to come up 
for a visit and I will soon.  Tomorrow (Thursday) may be a possibility.  Hope

Subject: Goldendale


Hey Dick, I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but I did want to reiterate 
out need for  the GE 7FA's  for our Florida projects. Although I understood 
from you that Goldendale was effectively done, I understand that you haven't 
yet gone through the dash process, so therefore a window of opportunity. We 
are looking to pay up to $40,000,000 for a GE 7FA for Ft. Pierce in addition 
to a commitment on the combined-cycle EPC contract. Our customer at Ft. 
Pierce is heavily engaged in finalizing contracts and will be prepared to 
execute in December. We must be able to commit to them (showing title to the 
que position) by then. 

I'd like you to compare your anticipated earnings on the Goldendale deal with 
earnings from moving this turbine to Florida. The $40 million should give you 
app. $3 million above cost, as well as incremental profits from the EPC 
contract. Also, you should know that we feel the Florida market has 
significant upside potential for Enron from a merchant standpoint and 
anticipate that our first-mover advantage will result in significant earnings.

Please let me know how you think Enron should proceed in comparing the two 
projects. Thanks Dick."	violation detected	This email contains proprietary business information, including details about potential financial transactions, customer contracts, and market strategies, which could pose a risk if publicly disclosed.

The attachment is a response to my information request concerning Reliant -
HL&P's installation of the big poles. Conversations after my letter's
receipt moved in the direction of possible community meetings where R-H
would explain what they were doing and answer our many questions.

Last Tuesday R-H informed me that since the installation project would be
completed by the end of this month, that the attachment would be sufficient
for their communication purposes. A meeting with us was not necessary.

The R-H spokesperson readily admitted that there had been no attempts to
obtain community imput/feedback prior the new pole installation.

I'm disappointed and frustrated. I need your thoughts on how to proceed.

Read the attachment and tell me what you think should happen next.

Paul,

I reviewed the data in the CBS system as well as the contract folders in order to respond to your questions.  Here are my findings:
Information regarding delivery point volumes provided by TK are correct.  
The requests for realignment on both contracts were effective 4/1/01 through the remaining term of the contracts.
There is a copy of the executed amendments in the respective contract folders and/or in Envision (K 25841 - amendment #66, K 26511 - amendment #34)
K 25841 has no language prohibiting PG&E ET-GC to realign during the term of the agreement
K 26511 does have language in a discount letter agreement dated 5/27/99 stating ""Shipper shall have a one time option during the term of the discount agreement while retaining the discounted rate to change primary delivery point capacity to PG&E Topock, subject to the availability of capacity at such point.""

If you have any questions, please let me know.  I'll give you a call with this information as well.

Elizabeth,

The original delivery points for these contracts were:

25841		40,000/d to Topock

26511		21,000/d to Needles


TK tells me that now the delivery points are:

		11,000/d to Needles

26511		11,000/d to Topock
		10,000/d to Needles

Can you tell me if this is correct? If yes, will these delivery points and volumes be in effect until the end of the contract? Can they be changed again? Do we have paperwork documenting the change?

Craig Buehler told me that Dennis Lee x-3-7115 could be of assistance. Could you speak with him?

I will be out for the rest of the week. Please call me at 713 825-8046 when you figure this out.

total megawatts accordingly. This could end up taking awhile, and I'm not 
sure the effect would be worth it. Again, let me know if you agree, because 
I'd like this report to be as applicable as possible.

2. I will run the EnPower deal count, excluding EES deals. I'll compare this 
count to the original one to determine how many EES deals were done by each 
desk, then double that number - to account for both sides of the sleeve - and 
subtract. I'll enter the altered numbers into the graph, which should produce 
a more accurate rendering of the day's activities.

I think I made it sound more complicated than it is. Bottom line, this should

Charlene,

Please, help. This is a son of a professor at Berkeley who helps me a lot in 
the recruiting process.
His son goes to Cornell. Can we invite him (the son, not the professor) to a 
Super Saturday? I really want
to repay the debt to his father who is very instrumental in  my recruiting 
efforts.

Vince

RIO DE JANEIRO -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) said Monday it will invest 
$455 million in its gas distribution business in Brazil from 2001 to 2004. 
Robert Gross, vice president of Enron's Brazilian unit, also said the company 
plans to spend $970 million on thermoelectric projects, but he didn't specify 
any timetables for the projects.
Gross said Enron will spend $142 million on gas distribution projects next 
year in Brazil. 
Currently, Brazil's energy regulator Aneel is in the process of licensing 
companies to build and operate a total of 44 new thermoelectric plants. 
U.S.-based Enron primarily operates in Brazil as a gas and energy 
distributor.

to make at LEAST $35K a year to meet the cost of living, etc.  I would also
ask for a signing bonus to go towards moving costs.  I am very serious about

loves me and that's fine.  But the other night when he thought I was

Doug Leach advised that he spoke with Sergio at Glencore yesterday, and 
Glencore is satisfied with the June 5 draft (copy attached) of the FSA, with 
the exception of 2 matters:
1.  He wants the LIBOR rate on late payments in Section 9.3 to be fixed on a 
specific day (e.g., the due date for the payment)
2.  He wants the ENE payment guarantee referenced in Section 9.5 to be 
increased to $7MM due to increased fuel prices.  
Doug is running these two points by Tom Moran on Monday, but doesn't believe 
they will be a problem (with respect to ENE furnishing the guarantee).

I intend to courier execution copies of the FSA to Glencore on Monday, after 
we get the confirmation from Tom Moran, unless any of you notify me of a 
problem with 
these changes.

Rogers,

Wanted to make sure that I mentioned that we have redone our balances
initially and they are showing something even uglier than we had discussed
.. something like a 1.3 TCF EO March 02. That would mean a loss of some 3.5
BCF/D of injection demand in summer of 2002. Not surprising, we are probably
going to revise our prices down and throw out the V bottom and grab a long,
wide U bottom .. no $3 prices for 2002. You know what we really mean. UNT
was rallying today at over $8. This thing could almost as ugly as the last
down cycle.

Last night Sheila Walton asked if I would be interested in being the Generalist for Corporate HR (just an extra assignment along with my other responsibilities).  I told her I would be interested but would need to talk with you about it and of course she would need to discuss it with David.

The reason I'm interested is because it would allow me to keep up with what is happening in the Generalist world.  When I was the HR Rep for HR North America, I mostly dealt with Employee Relations type issues for the HR group.  Although those type problems with HR occur infrequently it requires someone who could handle information confidentially and with sensitivity.  Sheila feels that someone from our group would also lend a certain amount of neutrality since our group is somewhat separate from the other Corporate functions.  Also it is right in line with my primary responsibility now, dealing with Employee Relations issues.  Sheila said she would provide all the administrative support needed and there is staffing to deal with hiring.  

I expect that the added duties would take less than 5% of my time.

Robert, 

There are three buy back tickets in Sitara for Equistar at mtr 1373.  Two for 
HPL and one under ENA.  Shouldn't we have only one buyback for each company?  
Also, how do you have the meter set up to allocate between the ENA contract

When I was in Calgary, Keith Petersen and I were talking about rates and certificates and he mentioned some seminars that the Omaha people do.  Additionally, we discussed some sites that would provide a variety of things to see.  Below is a possible schedule he sent me. 

What we would provide is a Certificates 101 training and answer questions (1 1/2 Hours), Steve Kirk's group would provide a rates and tariff 101 session that would take a full 2 hours or maybe more, and Tim Kissner would provide a cost of service presentation (how he arrives at a cost of service).  Tim's presentation takes another 1 1/2 hours.  This would take up one day.  Then I could provide the names or help you set up tours of the Redfield Underground storage, a tour of the Ogden compressor station, A tour of the Garner LNG, and possibly a tour of the Farmington Compressor station.  The Ogden station does not have turbine horsepower or electric driven units, but is a major compressor station on our system.  This would take most of two days to cover.  

I mentioned this idea to Eric and Steve and they are both very interested.  Also, Tony Pryor was there and he said Drew would be interested, and I got an e-mail from Nancy Bagot in the DC office wanting to participate.  I realize this could become a lot of people, but it could be a good opportunity for some practical experience and team building.  What do you think?

I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner on this.  I do have some questions 
regarding the attached notice.  What is the counter-offer methodology and 
when will we use it vs. FCFS.  Our tariff currently allows us to use the NPV 
methodology and does not state that we can use an alternate methodology.    
We need to rewrite the tariff provision.  Until then, we should definitely 
post the alternate methodology that we plan to use for at least 3 business 
days in advance.  Drew and Susan and I are supposed to meet on this subject 
today.  I will get their thoughts as well.  thanks, Maria

Attached is a draft of what could be added to the TW Website's unsubscribed

shipper was looking for unsubscribed capacity on our Website, they would also 
know we have capacity available on EOL.  The change also indicates that we 
may be using a different methodology for selling/awarding capacity than we 
have in our tariff.  What do you think?

John, 

After your conversation with Paul yesterday, we have evaluated the option of moving all of GAS and POWER next weekend, we will be able to move everyone in a single move, however we will need a firm commitment by midday Tuesday, in order for us to get the workforce, move the broker lines and all the other tasks associated with this scale of move.

If you would like to proceed, please let me or Bill Donovan know as soon as practicable, so we can facilitate the migration. 

If we do not move next weekend, this will cause real problems with the resources and contracts in place, staff and suppliers are on vacation through thanksgiving and the move data will soon be out of date which will need to be reconciled which would increase the cost.

During the summer, FERC initiated an investigation into the potential of unjust and unreasonable spot prices in the northwest from December of 2000 through June of 2001.  Seatlle City Light, Tacoma City Light, Eugene Water and Electric Board, and Sacramento Municipal Utility District all filed claims at FERC for refunds from EPMI.  The claims totaled close to $100 million.  However, many of these claims were, on their face, spurious.  For example, Eugene Water and Electric Board filed for refund of forward purchases which was clearly outside the scope of FERC's proceeding.

We hired consultants from Charles River Associates (CRA) to help us with this process.  One of their tasks was to apply the CAISO competitive benchmark pricing methodology to the Northwest market.  That is, CRA attempted to reverse engineer the CAISO's methodology in order to estimate our Northwest risk.

I was informed by our litigation team that EPMI's realistic potential exposure using this methodology was roughly $30 million.  We decided to reserve roughly 2/3 of this amount which came to about $21 million.

In September a FERC Adminitrative Law Judge heard the case and submitted a draft decision to the FERC.  The draft decision recommended against any refunds.  This draft decision is supposed to come in front of the FERC commissioners for approval before the end of the year.  If this draft decision is approved, it would be appropriate to remove these reserves."	violation detected	This text contains financial information, including specific amounts of money reserved for potential refunds, as well as details about the investigation and claims filed at FERC, which are sensitive business-related details.

Nevada PUC Acts To Change Or Void Long-Term Pwr Contracts 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The Nevada Public Utilities Commission Wednesday voted to allow its General Counsel Office to take any action necessary to try to void or renegotiate long-term electricity contracts entered into by the state's two largest utilities, a PUC spokeswoman said. 
The contracts would force Sierra Pacific Resources' (SRP) utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power Co. to pay a higher price for power than current market rates, said Don Soderberg, PUC chairman. 
""We paid high prices when the prices were high, but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous,"" Soderberg said. 
No one at Sierra Pacific or Nevada Power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities, or the value of the contracts. 
The PUC action follows a letter sent by Gov. Kenny Guinn to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early October asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts. 
The General Counsel's office will now have authority to file with FERC and in court to plead against the current contracts. 
Sierra Pacific has said that a June FERC order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company. Sierra Pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices, only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices, the company has said. As well, if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market, it will now receive less for that power under the cap, it has said. 
California 's Public Utilities Commission is also pushing for renegotiation of $43 billion in long-term contracts signed by the state, which has been buying power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities since January."	violation detected	This text contains proprietary business information about long-term electricity contracts, including details about pricing, companies involved, and actions being taken by regulatory bodies.

Harry Kingerski informed me that you and some team members were going to visit ConEd to discuss the Benchmark Rate Swap.  I think it's a great idea (Scott Gahn and I had discussed something similar a few years ago when he ran URM).  

My only thoughts for you would be: 1) maybe difficult to do the swap with the Utility (given PUC oversight), but the Holding company should be in the same place financially and should be protected from PUC scrutiny and 2) being long T&D (assuming that you don't sell 100% of the position to customers) creates interesting regulatory questions.

I'd love to sit down with you to discuss this product.

Subject: Canadian Tax Mitigation

Dave, we have come up with a structure that creates approx a C$45MM tax loss 
to offset our year-end projected C$50MM Taxable Income position. By doing 
this, we avoid cutting the government a cheque for roughly C$20MM. It seems 
to me that we should be able to recognize that $20MM as gross margin. We are 
meeting with Wes on Tuesday to discuss further but I thought that I should 
keep you in the loop as it is a significant transaction that you may want on 
your radar screen for your discussions with Wes.

Chris,
Good morning!  Hey, one thing I probably did not clarify to you yesterday on 
was that when the new deal ticket was set up for the $140 price strip (Deal 
#576468.1), the deal should only be in for (4/6/2001) according to APX's 
statement (not including 4/7/2001).  Therefore, the entire offpeak for your 
deal would be booked on Deal #572069.1 for the $150 price for 4/7/2001.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

offpeak ($140 & $150 - different MW per strip).  EPMI is showing $150 @ 12/MW

Enron PAC contributed $1,500 for her primary race (she had no race) and 
$1,000 for the general election. Her opposition is nominal. We have also 
handled various personal requests for her such as tickets to Enron Field. 

She has been helpful on several issues this year such as H1-B Visa and was in 
India with President Clinton at which she spoke to the Power Minister in a 
helpful way. Ken Lay and others jawboned her to get her vote in favor of PNTR 
for China although I think she was bargaining with everyone as she frequently 
does. Chris Long has developed a good relationship with Shiela but she seldom 
seeks us out and I think her ""delayed"" position on PNTR for China was 
unbecoming a representative from Houston. Houston will gain from PNTR for 
China. 

I would recommend a maximum of $2,000 to go along with our recommendation 
that she be more attentive to our positions on leading issues.

an open season; however, this product is for capacity release, which would 
not be subject to an open season--only bidding.  So, Gerald, unless you have 
some objection that we have overlooked, I believe it is appropriate to remove 
the words ""or open season"" in the product description.  Regarding the GTC, 
since we were planning on eliminating Paragraph 3 anyway, which had the open 
season reference, I think that one is already taken care of.

I understand that the deals are not actually flowing on Sunday but for 
auditing/reporting purposes per Melissa Murphy, these deals need to display 
the correct term of 2/17 only instead of 2/17-2/18.

The deals are:  523881, 523882, 523877, 523875, 523876, 523879, 523880, 
523883, and 523884

1. Because 2/18 is a Sunday and this is an off-peak deal, no hours will be 
counted for 2/18. If you need me to change the term anyway, I can. Let me 
know.
2. The rest of these deals traded on Bloomberg after Jeff Richter and Chris 
Mallory left for a power marketing conference. This caused many problems, as 
you can see. Following are the added or corrected deals: 

  1) 523831 - changed from Dynegy to Reliant - corrected
  2) 524481 - buy Duke/March-01/NP/265.00] - added
  3) 524482 - same terms - added

Let me know if you have any further discrepancies with these deals.

Congratulations on an apparently expanded role.  I know you have a lot more

resource requirements?   When you have a chance to discuss the implications

As my voicemail to Rob this evening indicated, we will be sending the documents for your review on Sunday afternoon.

We look forward to successfully executing another transaction with Chase.

Good Afternoon

Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers.

I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.
 
In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult.

regards

Ed  

Sophie. Could you please confirm that you are happy with the wording of the acceptance notice.

then I think at the next light  or one after that is ""WOERNER RD""  TURN RIGHT AND APPROX

624	"Mark, you may recall my memo to you in April, 1999 which indicated that for 
netting purposes, the conditions included:

1.  The transaction must be governed by a market standard master agreement or 
occur on a French regulated market

2.  One of the parties must be (a) an ""investment firm"" within the meaning of 
the law of 2nd of July, 1996, (b) an instituion or firm benefitting from the 
provisions of article 25 of the Law or (c) a non-resident entity having a 
""comparable status""

The term ""investment firm"" embodies financial type institutions which recieve 
and transmit order for financial instruments for third parties.

There are 12 categories of article 25 firms (including Bank of France, 
insurance companies, broker types, etc.)  .For example, one murky designation 
includes ""persons who supply an investment service which is ancillary to 
their professional activity, provided the rules governing such activity do 
not prohibt the carrying on of investment services"".  Slaughter and May has 
advised that they could assist us in determining whether our French 
counterparty fit this category and it definitely needs to be discussed with 
the counterparty (and extract a rep from them as well).  There are other 
categories as well.   I have a copy of the law if you would like to review.

The non-resident entity having ""comparable status"" is the category WE were 
trying for fit into without much success.

changed and Justin has a recent update.

Owners in relation to compliance with their obligations under the PPAs;
(b) it gave complaintants a mechanism to appeal a decision of the MSA not to 
further investigate a complaint to the Power Pool Council;
(c) it retained the mandatory referral mechanism by the MSA to another agency 
if the MSA's investigation determines the matter falls within another 
agency's jurisdiction (i.e. Competition Bureau) but has eliminated the 
requirement that upon such a referral the MSA cease its own investigation.   
The Power Pool Council now has the authority to determine whether the MSA 
should carry on with its investigation after a referral, or not.

I have not heard from you on the matter for some time and didn't get a

I note that we have since resumed trading with Hyundai (albeit with Hyundai 
Corporation and not Hyundai Singapore Pte Ltd which was the counterparty in 
the Pacific Valour case). I also understand that Enron Clean Fuels Company 
has chartered a vessel from Chembuk Trading which our broker advised to be an 
affiliate of MTM Ship Management (the bareboat charterers of the Pacific 
Valour and the likely respondents in an arbitration).

I presume the decision is therefore not to take the matter to arbitration and 
would like to close my file on the matter. However, if my understanding is 
incorrect, please let me have your instructions.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Jan Collins"	violation detected	This text contains explicit personal information such as full name, email address, and a physical address, as well as financial information related to Enron stock and donations. All of these details can lead to privacy risks and potential misuse.

Dave,

You asked about office costs, depreciation and headcount:

Office Costs are correct and include rent, supplies, backoffice expenses, 
general marketing and charitable contributions.

Depreciation includes leashold improvements (walls, carpet and paint) and 
certain computers/IT not covered in the IT allocation (Tim is checking on the 
$278K)

Headcount is close: my actual 2000 headcount is 38, not 36 and Tim's plan for 
2001 may be overstated by one or two; overall headcount increase is probably 
15, not 18.

Hope this clarifies the plan.

Greeting My Sisters In Christ,

I was just touching basis with the both of you as frontliners to say that
we are blessed and highly favored in the eyes of  God. On last night, the
group participated in a three-way and it was a blessing and it was agreed
on last night that we too would be participating in the fast on Wednesday
as well.

We all agreed to do the fast with water only, because we know that there
are different kinds of fast and I wasn't sure what others were doing, but
my feeling is that whatever we do as a unit and as long as we are doing it
to the Glory and Honor of God, then He honors what's in our hearts.

I believe that this is only the beginning of change and that God is truly
doing a new thing in the saints of God. The fast was a blessing for me on
today. I got up this morning with a spirit of expectation, not knowing what
to expect, but knowing that God was doing something powerful in the spirit
realm.

I believe that as we continue to walk in unity, keep our focus, commit our
work unto Him, that God will establish our thoughts and He will complete
that which He has started in us....A good work.

Be blessed :-)

Would be good if whoever is updating Jim Steffes slides from 29/3 could take 
a steer from the issues the report concentrates on, and either endorse/ 
explain them, or rebut/ disentangle them. Also we should bear in mind theme 
of Madrid conferenc is convergence of power and gas markets/ regulation, so 
gas market aspects for Western Area will be of partic. interest. Items to 
de-emphasise in very short slot available may be workings of PX and NOx

For potential lessons of relevance to Europe, I think Steve should 
concentrate on dangers in: decoupling of wholesale and retail market, 
attempted upfront guaranteed benefits to smaller consumers, and absence of 
adequate demand side, and generation investment, signals.

Can you help with this Dayton issue?  This is the one we discussed where 
Dayton is saying there is a fixed price and we have it in the system at 
index.  Can I get a list of all Dayton sales for CES so I can try to match 
them up?

We need to determine if this is another data entry error, or if CES provided 
us with incorrect data, or if Dayton is wrong and this really is an index 
deal.

Subject: CES - Term Sell for Dayton Power Light on TCO - PLEASE READ

This deal haunts us every month. Need someone to verify that CES GMS pricing 
equals Enron's Sitara pricing. 

Just a reminder, the GMS report I used from CES system only had volumes and 
no pricing. I ensured the physical volumes were correct. Commerical still 
needs to verify the pricing on the deals. I don't think this has been done 
yet.

CES DEAL TICKETS
gms ticket # = s-dpl-0070 
term = 12/1/98 to 5/1/2001
volume = 5000

gms ticket # = s-dpl-0079
term = 12/1/99 to 5/1/200
volume = 5000



ENA DEAL TICKETS
135702 = 5000.
It appears I changed volume to 0 on 2/29


145321 = 10,000
This ticket has been used for the total 10,000. This may be incorrect. (April 
forward deal # is 227296).

The physical total volume is correct in Sitara, not sure about the pricing.

Thank you for your assistance."	violation detected	This email contains proprietary business information related to sales, pricing, and deals for Dayton Power Light, which should not be publicly disclosed.

Also, the group is somewhat optimistic that the FERC order in November could 
be an order on the merits, without additional proceedings such as a technical

Connell: Power cost twice Davis' figure 
July 6, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity purchased under $43 billion of 
worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by 
Gov. Gray Davis' administration, state Controller Kathleen Connell said 
Thursday. 
Connell said her staff's analysis put the per-megawatt average at $170, 
compared with $69 to $79 estimated by Davis. 
Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another 
increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount likely 
would require some future increase. 
The controller, who writes the state's checks, said her figures assume fixed 
prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts, which range from a 
few months to 20 years. 
The administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the 
fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contracts 
would decline over time. 
Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration's numbers. 
""You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages, 
long-range or short-range contracts, peak power or nonpeak, and probably 
either average could be defended mathematically,"" said Nettie Hoge of The 
Utility Reform Network. ""We can't tell you whether it's $69 or $170 - the 
contracts are very convoluted and complex."""	violation detected	The text contains a link to contracts, which could be proprietary business information.

typos.



Greg and John,

I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of 
trades ( keeping the 
total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable.  This is partially 
because in a trending market
we lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose 
market move from
$30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL and the half bid-offer spread 
is $1 for simplicity, we take 5
 trades of short positions, the total MTM for that day is 
(-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$150,000 and total trading 
volume is 50,000 BBL short.  If per trade volume is 50,000 BBL, we take one 
trade, the total MTM is 
-5*50,000= -$250,000.   Thus the net difference between the two trading 
strategies is $10,000 for that
particular day.

Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the 
number of trades, we can be more
profitable as a market maker.  

I rerun a scenario that Stinson sent to you on Dec. 27 where he used per 
trade volume of 30,000 BBL.
I reduce the number of trade to 10,000 while increasing the number of trades 
by factor of 3.  Almost in all
cases, I saw increased profitability.  See the colume marked ""Change"" for 
dollar amount change in millions.

Please let Stinson or me know your thoughts on this.

Regards,

Zimin Lu

The person signing the escrow instruction must be someone who is listed on

Planes, fires, and floods along with my inability to use the stairs as a means of escape plus her desire to be ""back on the ground"" again add up to our moving into a one story patio styled home in a neighborhood just a couple of miles east of San Antonio !
Just joking about the location. . .It's off I-10 at Eldridge.

Closing on that property will be the first few days of December. Closing on The Spires is not known just yet. As far as actually moving out, we hope to be in the new place before December 23.  I would like to make a ""transfer of positions"" before Thanksgiving. 

It has been a joy working and playing with you and Ren these past several years. . .I will treasure those memories. . .you are indeed a very special lady.

Subject: Gallup - Continental Divide's contract proposal


Gerald,

I am sending up a copy of the proposed contract structure from Continental 
Divide
who is the local power utility associated with the Transwestern Gallup 
station.

Overall the commercial terms seem to be in line with all the discussions that 
have
been referenced, although there are some issues we want to make vary clear or
more apparent.

1) ECS is agreeing to a 3 yr term ""to buy power from Continental Divide"" 
assuming
     the merger is completed and power is available to ECS through the No. 21 
tariff.

2) They have provided none of the information concerning a split demand 
charge 
      that totals $12.21/kw.  Discussions reflect that $8.86/kw is avoidable 
and tied to
      their monthly coincidental peak load and the remaining $3.35/kw is a 
base type
      demand.  This is the basis of the rebate mechanism for TW.  Note this 
is also
      a Tri-State portion and part of the tariff 21.

3) ECS is aware of more favourable contract structures that Tri-State has 
negotiated
     and wants to maintain the ability to utilize a more favourable 
tariff/contract structure 
     or to negotiate specifics with Continental Divide post the Tri-State 
merger.   We 
     would still be buying from Continental Divide supporting their 3 yr term.

I am trying to get some written specifics from Continental Divide / Tri-State 
relative
to the demand avoidance since they are currently using this structure today.  
I'll let
you know.

Otherwise I wanted to get the document to you for your review.

721	"Thanks for your help in drafting a payment demand letter to Trailblazer.  

According to my contact at TBPL, Andy Edling, TBPL does not send a separate check to pay shippers for any excess credits that appear on an invoice.  The excess credits, with interest, are just rolled forward to offset future invoiced amounts.  Since ENA will be receiving more than our contract rate through September 2002 business from our capacity release deal, the letter should address the partial month capacity release deals for February 7-28, and the capacity release deal done for March through September 2002.  

Here are the specifics:

1)  Address the letter to Andy Edling, Account Director, Trailblazer Pipeline Company
	One Allen Center
	500  Dallas Street
	Suite 1000
	Houston, Texas  77002

2)  TBPL's invoice shows that $33,465.04 should be paid to us for February.  I recommend the letter say that for the February 7-28 capacity releases, a total payment of $52,706.62 to ENA should be due from TBPL.  This ignores the first 6 days of demand payments in February and the prior period interest charges that should be covered in the bankruptcy process.

3)  For March 2002 through September 2002, a monthly payment of over $177,000 per month should be paid to ENA.  It may be better to generally ask for the credit to be paid, rather than stipulate an amount for each of the months.

4)  Have Ed McMichael sign the letter.

5)  cc:  Mark Kissel

I will fax you the invoice.

Just a friendly reminder that tomorrow, Tuesday, August 15, is the day of the 
Economic Espionage Act presentation.  As you may recall, on August 1, I sent 
you an invitation to this presentation.   Our guest speaker is Mr. Dan Waltz 
from the law firm of Patton Boggs LLP.   In 1996, Congress passed the EEA.   
This Act helps shape how corporate American collects, uses and protects 
valued information.  Mr. Waltz will include in his presentation some 
hypothetical corporate case studies.   I believe this presentation will be 
most informative, and I hope that you will be able to attend.

The presentation is scheduled to begin at 1:30 and will be held in the 50th 
Floor Board Room.  If you have not yet confirmed your attendance to this 
presentation, please call my assistant, Sharon Purswell at 5-7212.   We hope 
to see you there!

Question:
Is the major maintenance reserve estimate based on a negotiated Long Term

PEF?
Answer:  We have not negotiated an LTSA with anyone at this time, and we do 
not expect to have one in place to transfer with PEF.  The maintenance 
reserve is our estimate based on industry data and information from GE.

Question: Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in 
the
capital cost estimate or are they assumed to be purchased through the
maintenance reserve estimate (i.e. the LTSA) charge?

Answer:  The maintenance reserve is intended to include parts and labor for 
the overhaul."	no violation detected

as we discussed, this is NOT an ad, and it's not intended to be presented as 
an ad, despite the fact that it very much looks like an ad.  rather, it's an 
illustration of how the research-based strategic insights to this complex 
issue can be distilled down to a single-minded concept with an easy visual

this ad out of context could misconstrue what it is and what its purpose is.

Jeanie Slone was telling me that you were among the best interviewers in the 
trading group.  Because of your expertise in this area, I was wondering if 
you could help me put some technical questions together that you've found to 
be effective in interviewing Gas Traders.

Norma Hasenjager is in our Omaha office needs this information ASAP in order 
to help her screen some candidates.  It would be great if you could respond 
to this with two or three questions that you've used in the past to select 
good Gas Traders.

Thanks for your help.

Subject: PSEG Request

Kay:

I talked with PSEG this morning.  PSEG would like to negotiate and sign a 
binding LOI regarding the Kendall project site in Illinois prior to 
negotiating and executing the Definitive SPA.  The specifics of this LOI are:

 PSEG would pay an up-front $300,000 payment to ENA 
 This payment would be non-refundable unless PSEG discovered a ""fatal flaw"" 
in the project (we will have to carefully define this concept)
 The binding LOI would establish a date by which the SPA would be executed or 
PSEG would forfeit the up-front payment
 The $2.7 MM balance of the Purchase Price would be due upon closing (signing 
the SPA and transferring the member interests).

I believe that PSEG is getting nervous that we may close on the Kendall LLC 
with another Buyer before they get their act together.

Call me to discuss the timing of drafting such an LOI.  I would like to 
strike on PSEG while they are anxious and motivated.  My goal is to send the 
LOI to PSEG by Wednesday of this week.  I can work directly with Carolyn if 
that is the most efficient approach.

Further to the PRC Committee Meeting please find attached the first draft of

The attached was completed some weeks ago by the HR leads in your business

Kean.

Under your review of the attached information, please focus on the final two 
pages that show the 'strawman' on how the functions fell out under the 
proposed peer group 
structure.

I have copied in the HR leads for your business area. They have been 
instrumental in completing the mapping and will meet with you to provide any 
specific information you require concerning placements with your business 
area.

I would point out that there does appear to be some inconsistencies in 
function placements within the peer groups for some business units; it will 
be our primary focus at the next meeting to resolves these issues.

Your assistants have been contacted regarding the time and date of our next 
meeting under separate cover. For our London colleagues we will aim for a

Subject: Retail Deal with Food Industry Alliance Closed

Last week, an aggregation deal closed with the NY Food Industry Alliance 
(FIA). It will be booked with a margin of at least $1.3 million. I sublet 
office space from the Food Industry Alliance in Albany, and I initated 
discussions between them and EES last Fall. I also worked with both EES and 
the President of the FIA in the final stages to bring the deal to closure and 
resolve a number of issues raised by several of the FIA's members. My 
physical location in the FIA's office suite was actually used by the 
President as a selling point to his members in the face of a slighly less 
expensive offer from a competitor."	violation detected	This message contains proprietary business information about a closed retail deal with the NY Food Industry Alliance, including financial details and the author's professional activities and affiliations.

Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported  by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data.

The standard contract size for all locations will  be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit  or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. 
The design and development of these new weather  products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized  leader in weather product concepts. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange has  worked with Aquila and other major weather market participants, including Reliant  Energy, Mirant Americas, and El Paso Merchant Energy, to build consensus and  support for these new products.

Subject:	Re: Colonial Outstanding AR   

According to Dick's notes from the deal ticket, we recalled the gas on 12/7/00, 12/28-31/00, 3/8/01, 3/22/01 and 3/24-26/01.  In talking with Cindy, it appears that at least two tickets were put into Sitara.  One ticket was our sale to Colonial and another ticket has us buying back from Colonial.  Sitara # 658124 is the ticket covering the buyback for March 2001.  Looking at the ticket in Sitara, there is an inconsistency between the Sitara volumes and the Unify bridged volumes.  Cindy, have you had a chance to check into this?

I hope all of you had a great Easter weekend!  The weather here in Portland was actually nice for a change (it's been rainy for the past 2 weeks, although we can't complain because we desparately need the rain).

As many of you know, we will all be meeting this Wednesday in Houston to discuss DMS.  I look forward to meeting everyone face to face!

While I am away from my desk next week, there will be no one working on DMS's, as Caroline and the rest of the Portland Volume Management team are extremely occupied with California and our new systems.  I have been going DMS alone for the past month and have been trying to stay on top of everything, however, given the volume of DMS's and obligations that I have to our Portland team, I have not had a chance to review all DMS's outstanding.  My apologies for this. 

I will be working strictly on DMS's today (Monday) and tomorrow (Tuesday), and at this point, I'll ask that you send me an e-mail with any urgent or semi-urgent  DMS's that cannot wait until next week.  I will work as late as necessary tonight to finish as much as possible.

Please call if there is anything that needs to be discussed.
I'm sure I'll be hearing from you soon.

place at 31 Dec 2000 when Enron Metal Recycling was divided into two halves: 
MGMR and Bergman.  Our overall controls assessment per risk at that stage was 
level 2 (below average controls).  

We have sumarised the implementation steps required to achieve an increase in 
controls assessment to level 3 (average), 4 (good)  or 5 (excellent) in each 
case,  along with latest completion dates to achieve those controls. 

We have then added a column of comments on the actual implementation with a 
bar chart to show how far advanced the work is.  The revised controls 
assessment at 31 Jan shows an average of 2.5 and our plan should enable the 
controls to be around a level 3 (average) by end of February. 

We will issue a revised table monthly in order to clearly update you on our 
progress.  If you would like to schedule a specific meeting to go through any 
of the points or queries that you may have, please let me know and I will 
organise.

***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for December 22 is:

syncretic   \sin-KREH-tik or sing-KREH-tik\   (adjective)
     : characterized or brought about by the combination of
different forms of belief or practice

Example sentence:
     Dr. Portman practices a syncretic form of medicine,
borrowing from both Eastern and Western medical traditions.

Did you know?
     ""Syncretic"" has its roots in an ancient alliance. It's a
descendant of the Greek word ""synkretismos,"" meaning
""federation of Cretan cities"" -- ""syn-"" means ""together, with,""
and ""Kret-"" means ""Cretan."" The English word ""syncretic""
retains the idea of coalition, and appears in such contexts as
""syncretic religions,"" ""syncretic societies,"" and even
""syncretic music."" ""Syncretic"" also has a specific application
in linguistics, where it refers to a fusion of grammatical forms.

Please Note: The Word of the Day will not be e-mailed on

the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's

the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For

Louise,

I don't think I have seen you this year - Happy New Year!

I have been asked what company name should be put on the business cards of 
some of Sally Beck's group.  I have been telling most people to stick with 
they organisation names e.g. Enron North America or Enron South America, 
rather than Enron Americas/Enron Wholesale Services.  Do you want everybody 
to use Enron Net Works, or should the trading support groups use their

BAD job of getting there stuff in the P&L and Enpower.  We are having to 
spend too much time going back and researching tags and comparing enpower to 
P&L and vice versa before we can even begin to checkout.  I spent two hours

that's why we do checkout's but much of this I feel is just laziness and guys

I have the following comments:
Credit Data
I believe the write-up is accurate, but I have cc'd Paul on this memo to confirm.

Financial Trading Risk Data
We provide aggregate position data for ETS not aggregate VAR, e.g.  ETS is long 10 MMCFD natural gas at Ventura for January 2002, etc. vs. ETS has $1.5 million total VAR.  This is necessary for two reasons: 1.) Enron's VAR does not necessarily equal the sum of its subsidiaries VAR since there may be offsetting positions  throughout the business units.  2.)  Our trading books software (Caminus) does not have the capability to compute VAR in accordance with the specific methodology required (Monte Carlo simulation) in the Enron policy.

Project Analysis Data
I think this write-up is accurate, but I have cc'd Lisa and Cheryl to confirm.

878	"Dave,
 I will be glad to generate the form of Transaction Agreement; however, I 
have a number of questions.
1.  Relationship of Delivery Point and the use of Interruptible Transport on 
Northwest Pipeline.  Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery 
point?  If downstream, why isn't it being contracted for by EWEB.  
2.  What volume is being sold each day.  You use the term DCQ and you also 
talk about a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity.  Normally 
their would be no tolerance with a DCQ transaction.  
3.  Is this envisioned to be a requirements transaction.  Is the price the 
same for volumes in excess of the estimated quantity up to an additional 
20%.  Is no penalty to apply if the actual volumes are 0% to 20% less than 
the estimated quantity?  What if they take more than 20% in excess without 
making any arrangements for incremental gas.  What price is to be used for 
such non scheduled excess volumes? 
 Please call me regarding the foregoing so that I can start to work on the 
transaction agreement.

1. Sen. Alpert Legislation on Rate Caps

 - Senator staff recognizes the legislation has ""problems""
 - Senator is still looking to move something with another vehicle
 - Enron MESSAGE:  ""CPUC is fixing the problem, legislature should do 
nothing; if you decide to do     something, then use Enron's fixes"" (which 
simply codify the CPUC's decision)
 -  focus on customers' support for our legislative fix rather than IEP
 - Jeff D. to talk with customers, give them our fix, tell them to sit tight, 
and contact Sandi M. to discuss
 - Sandi M. to talk with Sen. Alpert about our fixes

2. Continue to support Williamson Act fix for Pastoria
 - Committee meeting on 8/18 fo Urgency bill
 - no opposition identified to date (some question about Farm Bureau though)
 - Sandi M. to attend meeting to support bill

Subject: Petrochem Desk

I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to 
curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in 
April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at 
construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or 
SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of 
the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked 
about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been 
around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John 
Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.   

From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at 
least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to 
understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday 
during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX 
component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could 
then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors 
(e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

Electricity deregulation brings on crisis in California 
? 
09/25/2000 
API EnCompass: News 
(c) Copyright Elsevier Engineering Information, Inc.  All rights reserved. 

From: Petrostrategies --

California's power generators blame the 'rigid nature' of the deregulated 
energy sector for the prevailing electricity crisis, which has seen wholesale 
power prices jump by as much as $500/Mwhr from $150/Mwhr in summer 1999 even 
as retail prices have been frozen until March 2002. Meanwhile, since demand 
has grown by a mere 3% from mid-1999, some consumers fear that the crisis has 
arisen, not from Californian deregulation, but from power generators who are 
taking advantage of the crisis to earn more. Tasked to act on the problem, 
FERC is to announce the results of its probe on the energy crisis by 
11/1/2000.

901	"Rick:   I wanted to give you an update on what's going on with 201 on steel imports:

Late Friday evening, Zoellick sent a letter on behalf of the Bush Administration to the  International Trade Commission formally initiating a Section 201 investigation for the steel industry.  Most, if not all, products that Enron imports were included in the scope of the investigation.  

I left messages for Jeff, Tim and Greg Hermans (trading) over the weekend that this is now official (they had previously made an announcement that it would happen, but we didn't know details because the filing had not been made).  

I am working with Jeff M. and Public Affairs on our statement on 201.  It has been through several iterations over the past week.   Do you want to review before it's finalized?   We do not plan to issue any statements, but we plan to talk from these points when asked about our position (by reporters or govt officials).   Jeff wants our approach to be ""moderate"" given where we are with the domestic producers.  

We are putting together a timeline for the 201 investigation, spelling out important milestones in the process.   This will help our commercial team to understand what is coming down the pike (and when).  It looks like the investigation will take approx 9-12 months to complete from start to finish.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Leslie, I presented a form of assignment to PG&E as recently as 2 weeks ago( including other structures).. Generally speaking, they HATE the El Paso pipe because of it's flow risk and are not interested in discussing this with me until such time that EL Paso deliverability becomes more reliable. 

Having them take this pipe as a vehicle to help offset our bankruptcy claim works from an economics point of view ( assuming you can agree on values), but I think you will have a battle regaring the quality of service that they are going to get. Regardless, it is a an out of the money position for us and we could accomodate if they wish to discuss further. Have Lisa or Michael call me if they wish to discuss logistics around this asset.

I believe the better understanding of the program that you provided will allow me to better manage and coordinate the activities of the analysts in the real-time group in Portland.

done, so would have really enjoyed the workshop yesterday.  I am still
considering doing some or all of the Motorcade Friday, however that may
work.

Separately, thanks for the update in the lobby today on the Enterprise Risk
project.  Please keep in touch with me.  As I mentioned, my redeployment
period ends tomorrow (April 26), but I currently do not have an outside job
lined up and still have a lot of interest in the project if something can be
worked out over the next few weeks.  Although he is not in the same group as
David Port, I have worked a lot with Brad Larson in the RAC underwriting
group - he may be a good source of information on me also.

Subject: HPL Meter



Here is the message I received from my technical folks. (below in red).
As you can see a lot of work is involved.  Let me know how much you would
plan to nominate at this point, etc.    And can they committ to a certain,
volume, etc.   Also,  have they talked to HPL about taking gas at this
point.


After visiting the site (M&R 71886/76886), I found the following work that
would need to be done before custody transfer measurement could be
performed :
 (The site has two 12"" meter runs with valve switching (bidirectional flow)
and run switching - and has not flow gas in over 10 years)

1. All valves will need to be inspected & overhauled
     A. Run switching valve - major overhaul (needs to be sent off for this
work)
     B. Control valves - inspected & overhauled (needs to be sent off for
this work)
     C. Small regulators overhauled
2. Both meter tubes pulled and inspected
     A. Sr. fitting needs to be overhauled
     B. Tubes will need to be honed (needs to be sent off to have fitting
overhauled and tubes honed)
3. All transmitter need to be replaced
     A. Differential - 2
     B. Temperature - 2 (1 additional from original setup)
     C. Pressure - 4
     D. Direct mount manifolds - 2
     E. UPS system
4. RTU boards need to be furnished
     A. Mother board
     B. STI REM
     C. Main terminal board
     D. Serial IO LEM
     E. Analog Output board
5. New batteries ( 4 @ $ 160)
6. Two sets of orifice plates (In .50"" increments through Beta range)

It would take at least 1.5 months to re-work the station controls and
associated valves, meter runs, and EGM.  If you need more information
please let me know."	violation detected	This message contains proprietary business information, technical details about metering equipment, and operational procedures that could expose private business operations and sensitive infrastructure details.

Sherry/Errol:

I just got a request from Todd Lambert at EES to retroactively do a trade for 
expired months.  The details are:

EES sold NYMEX gas contracts to a customer named Springs Industry for futures 
months October, November, and December 2000.

However they were not supposed to sell to the customer directly at that 
point.  He wants to know if we can work out a deal where he instead sold 
those contracts to us and then have us sell to the customer.

There would be no net position and we would just serve as a pass through for 
their deal.

I'll come by later today to see if we can do it.

Process is well underway with the West Power Portfolio.  We have the portfolio sorted by:

- MTM position
- terminated vs active
- collection risk 
- type of contract

We have strategies for our top 5 exposures representing $600MM+ of estate assets and we are in discussions with several marketers that are looking at assignments.  There are 5 commercial and 3 legal people working on this.  

Going forward, JonAlan Page (Portland Estate) is interested and would be very good. Brad Richter is also interested and has one or two junior commercial people in mind to help as well (Brandon Wax).  I think Brad is a perfect fit - he knows some of the contracts, counterparties and he knows the marketers and attorneys in Portland.   He and I spoke today and agreed that it made sense for him to start working on this subject to your approval.   

My thought is that the commercial and legal team expands with the addition of Brad, Brandon and JonAlan and then it contracts when Netco starts pulling them in a different direction in January.

need to conserve.

Robert Mondavi Winery and Baron Philippe de Rothschild, purchase limits on 
the current vintage of Opus One will change from twelve to six 750 ml.

October of this year, at which time the 1998 will be released.

Subject: New real options presentation

All

Attached in the latest version of my real options presentation, which I'll be 
presenting at a Real Options Group conference in Cambridge next month.

I've removed the gas storage pricing example, and instead put in a simple 
example to show that my method can reproduce decision tree approaches (should 
one wish to do so).  This is a response to the heavily decision-tree 
dominated approach taken by most people at the last conference I spoke at.  I 
want to demonstrate explicitly that my approach covers both decision tree and 
option pricing as special cases, the synthesis needed for correct real option 
valuation.

My presentation now covers:
1. Decision trees.
2. Binomial option pricing trees.
3. Power station valuation.
4. Power asset development.
The option pricing and power examples are based on the (too simplistic) 
binomial tree method.  I obviously won't indicate my thoughts on the most 
correct way to do this.

970	"I will tell him what I know, although I haven't looked at a food processor in some time.  

Matt - I would suggest you talk to Matt Gravelle from ConAgra.  I have done him some favors over the years.  They are a big food processor with Beatrice Hunt Wesson.  He will know all the big tomato processors which are 80% of the food processing load.  Others include Tri-Valley.  I would try to get as many names and phone numbers as you can and call them up and ask them their plans.  My bet is cooler and wetter weather will result in a lower and later harvest and hence gas usage.  
The fruit driers are the other 20% and they are much less concentrated and it will be hard to get a handle on their usage.

Also, what's up with EES?  Do they have any marketers anymore?  Dan Bergmann used to be very effective in getting deals done with the food processors, but they laid him off.

people.  I personally have lost over $40,000 in my 401K which I was heavily

Two things I did not manage to mention to you at the meeting on Monday.

1. Joe Carson. I was very positively impressed by Joe Carson.
     Enron  badly needs a senior economist of his stature and 
     experience. He has many contacts in the industry and can represent 
     Enron well. He is very pragmatic and, also, I expect a cool head on old 
     shoulders.

     One negative is that he wants to work out of New York. The tradeoff is 
between
     maintaining  his contacts and working closer with the desks. 

2. Tony Mends. I think you, or Louise, should explore the possibility of 
using the skills of Tony Mends.
    Tony and I are good friends so I may be biased. I think that he is a very 
smart
    and efficient person and can contribute a lot to the organization that

Hi Kay! How are you guys doing? We had hoped that maybe we would be coming
over to Houston Saturday to see UT play baseball and then maybe try to see
yall Sunday before we drove back. BUT! As luck would have it, Annie, Katie
and Bobby are all various degrees of sick.

So, unless there is miraculous improvement in the next 24 hours, it looks
like we will be staying in Austin. Oh well. We hope to make another trip
down there before too long.

Well, I'm due at school, but I wanted to say hi and tell you that we won't
be coming down. I hear that Mac is coming down? That's great. I hope that he
likes what he sees at UH. You know his girlfriend has been offered a
scholarship to Rice, I think.

Anyway, Have a great Ground Hogs Day. It doesn't feel too different to be
40, rather than 39 and 364 days, so I guess I'll make it through the day.

Take care and tell everyone hello!

Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.

1021	"Ken:

This idea might be more appropriate for the Management Conference rather than tomorrow, but I suggest a fifth value or at least implicit emphasis of a value within our values--humility.

There are different dictionary definitions of the term, but the one that fits Enron best is ""not proud or haughty; not arrogant or assertive.""  We want to be proud but not haughty, arrogant, or assertive, so there is a fine line with the term.

""Humility"" is really a necessary characteristic of any firm participating in the ""creative destruction"" of open markets.  It reflects the fact that 1) the market and exogenous events are orders of magnitude greater than any one company, individual, or institution, and 2) a company's performance, no matter how positive, is just a temporary, even fleeting, evaluation of consumers, investors, employees, and the general public.  After all, everyone has choices.

The humility value has been one of the most important for Charles Koch of Koch Industries.  Koch has certainly had their share of problems and has a very different business model from Enron.  But what is important is that Charles is a very serious student of market-based ideas and sees this value coming straight from Joseph Schumpeter, F. A. Hayek, and others in the free market vanguard.  I wholly agree.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Dean Muesing"	violation detected	This text contains explicit personal information such as full name, address, and email address, as well as financial information related to Enron stock transactions and funds, which could lead to privacy risks and potential misuse.

We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market.

3. Are there baseload facilities that were operated differently in 2000 than 
in 1999?
4. Were any generation plants off-line due to unplanned maintenance during 
Summer 2000?
5. How did the CA ISO demand side program work?  Why didn't more load 
participate?  
6. What options did SDG&E have to ""hedge"" its retail rates?  What were prices 
in the CAL PX block forward market on Jan 15, 2000 and May 15, 2000?
7. How high did natural gas prices go in California for generation during 
Summer 2000?
8. Were other Western power markets prices higher (year-on-year)?
9. Did the CA ISO Board face political pressure to reduce bid caps?  Is this 
appropriate for a FERC jurisdictional entity?

Subject: FERC reports on Plant Closures in Callifornia and Northwest Prices 
in Nov & Dec

Good News.  FERC issued three reports yesterday:  a Response of the Staff of 
the FERC to Questions Posed at December 20, 2000 Western Governors 
Association Denver Meeting; a Staff Report to the FERC on Northwest Power 
Markets in Nov. and Dec. 2000; and a Report on Plant Outages in the State of 
California.  All three reports can be downloaded from FERC's page on bulk 
power markets, found at http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.htm. 

From a quick scan of the pricing and outage reports, the results are very 
favorable.  FERC found no evidence that plants were down for other than 
maintenance or emissions problems.  The pricing report found that prices in 
the NW during the two months tracked the increased demand and supply 
shortfall."	no violation detected

Under the definition of ""Spot Market Service"" it now reads:

This service is available for Large Customers and Medium Customers whose service from a Direct Access provider has been interrupted, or who have failed to elect or be deemed to elect either Direct Access, Core Service or Term Service. 

I don't understand the meaning of the phrase ""or be deemed to elect.""  If inserting the phrase serves an important purpose, then perhaps it's appropriate to leave it in.  But we haven't discussed any reason for needing it.  As such, given the last-minute nature of the change, it should be deleted.

There is one heckuvalot of detail in the rate-related language that Edison provided that we didn't have a chance to discuss in our negotiations.  It may turn out that it's all fine, but I frankly haven't haven't had the chance to adequately wrap my meager mind around the language, so I just want to let folks know that many more comments on those pieces may pop up from my end in the near term.
Finally, I just want to raise a flag on section 25465 (a) (6) regarding the green portfolio standard.  We never discussed/analyzed those additional percentages and consequently we never established a ""zone of comfort"" around including those numbers.  That may become an issue (and may not, just wanted to briefly flag it).

Thanks again for all the effort.

Peter,

The details of the promissory note (""Loan Note 2002"") from Greenfield to ECTRI in payment of agreed interest rate swap breakage costs in connection with the November 2001 Greenfield equity sale/LAKSHMI vessel financing workout transaction are as follows:

Maker: 			Greenfield Shipping Company Limited
Holder:			Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.
Guarantor: 		Mitsui OSK Lines, Ltd.
Date of Note: 		November 20, 2001
Principal Amount:	US$12,720,000.00
Interest Rate: 		5% per annum (based on 360 day year)
ECTRI Swap Deal No.:	M148198

Repayment Schedule*:
	1st Payment:	January 31, 2002 -- US$561,621.52 (includes principal and interest)
	2nd Payment:	February 28, 2002 -- US$561,621.52 (includes principal and interest)
	3rd Payment:	March 29, 2002 -- US$561,621.52 (includes principal and interest)
	Final Payment:	April 30, 2002 -- remaining balance of principal plus accrued interest.

	* Notwithstanding the foregoing schedule, the Loan Note is repayable in full upon refinancing of the vessel by Greenfield. 

Hope this helps.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  I'm copying Enron lawyers Alan Aronowitz and Sara Shackleton on this note so that they are also aware of the details of this ECTRI receivable and the fact that MOL appear to be arranging payment on behalf of Greenfield to ECTRI (at least for the January and February 2002 instalment obligations).

Sara,
Thank you for your fax.
Section 180.3 of the CEA prohibits us from agreeing to any settlement
procedure/forum ahead of time.  JPMFI, in accordance with 180.3, will offer 3
forums - which will include AAA.  If Enron chooses AAA, the arbitration will 
be
subject to the provisions specified in your fax dd 2/26/2001.

Attached is JPM's proposed language for the arbitration agreement.

(See attached file: ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.doc)

If you are in agreement with the language, please forward Enron's proposed
language (detailed in your 2/26 fax) electronically (if available).

Thank you and Regards,
Corinne

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Sarah Rimer"	violation detected	This text contains explicit personal information such as full name, physical address, and email address, as well as financial information related to Enron stock and donations. All of these details can lead to privacy risks and potential misuse.

		 Subject: Deal Blotter question

I've run across what seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter; although it may be 
caused by the default settings in a specific trader's blotter. A few times 
over the last several weeks, our traders at the Short Term Southwest desk 
have entered off peak deals by choosing the ""off"" selection under the ""Hours"" 
heading. But the mask doesn't change to include Sundays and Holidays, and the 
traders then enter another deal to compensate for this. What we've found then 
is that the original deal did in fact include a strip for Sundays and 
Holidays, round-the-clock hours.

My question is - when you enter an off-peak deal in Deal Blotter, does it 
automatically read that as Mon. through Sat. off-peak hours AND Sundays and 
Holidays round-the-clock? Even though the mask does not change to show 
Sundays and Holidays? I'm just wondering if there is an easier way to assure 
that we've entered off-peak deals correctly other than double-checking them 
in Deal Entry.

Please call or e-mail when you get a chance. Again, this could be just a 
matter of incorrect settings in someone's blotter; but I'd like to make sure 
either way.

Thanks for your time,

Kevin 

As I mentioned to you, due to some recent success in obtaining additional security, we are extending credit to Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc. to transact on the day ahead and balance of week markets only.  We will not be granting them execution rights on EOL due to the lack of controls/functionality for daily transactions.  EOL, unlike ICE, has tenor function set by months versus number of days.  As a result, in the case of Edison Mission, if we set EOL for one month, Edison would have access to balance of the month plus next month.  It seems to make this work for Edison and perhaps other potential counterparties, it would either require reengineering of the system or possibly coming up with dividing the products to incorporate daily transactions.  If you would like to discuss further, please call.

		 Subject: Meeting w/Sempra

FYI.  Recently, Chris Calger has asked me to set up a meeting with Sempra.  
ENA's seeking deals with the two big CA gas IOUs (PG&E and SoCalGas) that 
would give ENA access to their assets.  In short, ENA wants to offer a 
complete outsource deal for the IOUs' core gas load (i.e., rez and small 
commercial customers).  ENA would take responsibility for providing service 
for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of core's assets 
(upstream of the city gate).  We're meeting with Sempra's ""Chief Regulatory 
Office"" (Bill Reed) and Sempra's CFO next Thursday to discuss.

Given the fact that Sempra's primarily focused on electricity, the plan is to 
lead off the meeting with a couple of electricity solutions as a bridge to 
the gas offer.  For electricity, the plan has two pieces:  1) a commodity 
offer that beats the 6.5 cent cap (i.e., nothing fancy) and 2) ""Deal Bench"" 
services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for SDG&E 
that the California PUC could pre-approve (thereby eliminating some of the 
immense regulatory risk SDG&E now faces).

Wanted to run this by folks to gauge reactions.  We'll distribute the slides 
we're putting together as soon as they're drafted--hopefully by COB Friday.

Best,
Jeff"	violation detected	"The email contains proprietary business information about ENA's deals with gas IOUs, details about a meeting with Sempra's ""Chief Regulatory Office"" and CFO, and plans for electricity solutions. This information is confidential and should not be publicly disclosed."

Subject: ESA equipment purchase

Ben,

Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.  
One issue is when this transaction can close.  Since the equipment is owned 
by WestLB and since the feeling is we don't want to involve WestLB in the 
transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the 
WestLB facility.  If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle 
back with Lisa.

A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both 
ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for 
payment for changes, storage, etc.  As far as I know, this concept hasn't 
been addressed with GE.

I re-calculated the overhead charge, so you might want to check it out.

I look forward to your comments.

We will give them two-ways for their screen on ""key"" products. What constitutes a key product is discrestionary. There is no minimum spread we have to provide.

This is not an exclusive relationship.
This deal is not linked to EOL.
Either side can terminate at any time if it's not working out.

Effectively all this means is that we have another route to market, which ends up being 0.25p/MWh cheaper.

Spectron are keen to monitor this with a view to adopting something similar on other desks.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Your action in this matter would do much more to refurbish your image and your name than your wife's current campaign to make you appear as a victim.  Do the right thing and save her the effort.

Sincerely,

Kristen Bain"	violation detected	This text contains explicit personal information such as full name, address, and email address, as well as financial information related to Enron stock and donations, all of which can lead to privacy risks and potential misuse.
1141	"Dear Ken:  The purpose of this note is to seek your help in becoming a 
citizen of the US.

I've been a Houston-based employee of Enron for nearly 10 years, of which 
seven were with the Dabhol project.  I obtained my green card in 1992, which 
entitled me to apply for US citizenship in 1997.  I recently went through the 
final interview and was awaiting a call to take oath.

Instead, the INS denied my application for citizenship on grounds of my 
extensive travel.  This, despite the fact that:

(1).  A disqualification can be made only if an applicant is 

- out of the country for a continuous period of six months; or
- is out of the country for more than 30 months in the sixty month period 
after the green card.  (Neither of these apply to me).

(2).  I had filed a notification to the INS immediately after getting my 
green card (in 1992) informing them that I will be travelling extensively on 
business.  Filing this notification allows me to travel without the 
restrictions mentioned above.

Ken, I need your help on two fronts:

(1).  Support in filing an appeal to the INS.  This will cost an outside 
counsel between $1500-$3000.

(2).  Request my US Representative Mr.DeLay to send the attached letter to 
the local INS administrator.

I believe this will clear the way for my becoming a citizen of the US, to 
which I eagerly look forward.

1) Currently the midterm consists of 8 questions.
2) In addition there is an extra credit question.  This question is VERY
difficult (I never give extra credit easily), and should definitely not be
attempted until you have finished everything else.
3) The questions are arranged approximately in order of difficulty.  Please
try not to throw away points by making mistakes on the gimme questions.
4) The last few questions are harder, so don't waste too much time on the
easy questions.  Still, 2 hours should be more than sufficient to do the
midterm. (I expect most people to finish in 1.5 hours.) I would give you
longer, but the time limit is actually for your benifit.  If I give you more
time, all that happens is students tend to obsess.  I have actually
witnessed students cross out a perfectly correct answer and replace it with

George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

other possible openings Enron might have.

Today I've saw an add for the Junior DBA position in
Houston and I was wondering  if it might be in your
company. I beleive I told you, that I'm pretty open
for different position. I was doing a lot of
development projects in Berkley and enjoyed it. I've
also found DBA work also very challenging and
rewarding. I would be very intersted in joining the

I'm opening for relocation and I think with knowledge,
experience and my enthusiasm to learn and ability to

Hope to hear from you soon.

I will be on vocation starting next week.  I attached the simulation models

The Word of the Day for January 25 is:

corybantic   \kor-ee-BAN-tik or kahr-ee-BAN-tik\   (adjective)
     : like or in the spirit of a Corybant; especially : wild,
frenzied

Example sentence:
     Thousands of corybantic fans writhed and screamed in a
frenzied dance to the driving guitars and the pounding beat of
the rock band ""Steel Sweat.""

Did you know?
     The big name in goddesses in Phrygia (Asia Minor) in the
fifth century B.C. was Cybele (also called Cybebe or Agdistis),
the ""Great Mother of the Gods."" According to Oriental and Greco-
Roman mythology, she was the mother of it all -- gods, humans,
animals, plants, nature itself. The Corybants were Cybele's
mythical attendants, and they worshipped her with an unrestrained
frenzy of wildly emotional processions, rites, and dances.
""Corybantic,"" the adjective based on the name of Cybele's
attendants, can be used to describe anything characterized by a
similar unrestrained abandon.

The following energy bills will be heard today.

SBX2 78 (Polanco/Sher), SCE MOU, will be heard by the Assembly Energy, Costs
and Availability Committee upon adjournment of the Assembly Transportation
Committee (approximately 2:30 p.m.) in room 437.  Late Friday, Assemblyman
Hertzberg informed his caucus that the Assembly may take this measure up on
the floor as early as today.  Because floor session is currently scheduled
for 11:00 a.m. this would require the Assembly to reconvene late this
afternoon, however, this has not been scheduled and such an action would
likely interfere with several Assembly fundraising events this evening.

SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott), windfall profits tax, will be heard by the Assembly
Revenue and Taxation Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 126.

SB 532 (Sher), renewable portfolio standard, will be heard by the Assembly
Natural Resources Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 447.  This measure would
require DWR and/or the IOUs to purchase specified amounts of renewable
energy."	violation detected	The email contains the names of several individuals, which is considered sensitive information. Additionally, it mentions specific energy bills that are being heard, which could be considered proprietary business information.

1184	"Though there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding whether and when Davis will call back the California legislature to address the Edison MOU, here's the latest information we have.
Faced with horrible polling, an unwilling legislature, an uncooperative California PUC, and a wily leader of the state Senate (Burton), Davis is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature.
Rumors of a delay come despite Davis' statements that he would call them back next week.
We received the information about a likely delay from an Edison SVP who's working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow.
It's Edison's view that the earliest Davis would now call the legislature back is end of next week, with early the following week being most likely.
At this point, the chance remains that Davis may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off, leaving Edison to follow PG&E into chapter 11.
In the meantime, negotiations between Davis' staff, and staff from the Senate and Assembly continue.

We'll report back with information as we get it.

Products will be settled in the currency they are traded in....that is USD, 
Euro or GBP
We would intend the new Enron softs entity to be a US entity and that the UK 
trading would be done through the arranger....EEFT.

With respect to this new counterparty for EnronOnline (correct name to

Sam Schott advises us that we are limited to 90 characters for a counterparty 
name in GCP.  The correct legal name for this counterparty is longer than 90 
characters.  I discussed this with Marcus Nettelton, our power lawyer, and if 
the following scenario meets with the approval of the financial and physical 
power Confirmation Desks we think the best way to treat this matter is to set 
the counterparty up in GCP as follows and then add this counterparty to the 
special handling list so all confirmations, physical and financial, offline 
and online, go out with the LEGAL NAME, not with the GCP NAME.

LEGAL NAME OF COUNTERPARTY:  Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as 
authorized agent for and on behalf of IES Utilities Inc., Interstate Power 
Company, and Wisconsin Power and Light Company

SUGGESTED NAME FOR GCP:   Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as Agent 
for three listed utilities

Joe and Kim, is this workable for the Confirm Desks?  If you can let me and

Dear Mr. McConnell, my name is Rudy Hirschheim, and I'm the past Director
of the Information Systems Research Center at the University of Houston.
Enron is a member of our group and I was friends with Alberto Gude, Enron's
former IT Director. I have a request that I wondered if you could help with.

Perez Companc - a big oil and gas company in Argentina - is trying to
understand how some of the big US companies are dealing with IT. Basically
interested in issues such as sourcing arrangements, structure
(centralized/decentralized/distributed), customer relationships, use of
packaged software, 'e' issues, and such like. They want me to try to set up
meetings with some key US companies here in Houston. Among the companies
which I suggested they talk to is yours. Do you think someone/some group
would be willing to talk to a contingent of Perez Companc folks? Would
Enron be willing to share things which weren't considered
competitive secrets with them?? They were hoping to come up either the
first or second week in March. My role is to try to put together visits to
the Shell/Texaco JV, Shell, Texaco, Exxon-Mobil, Conoco, BHP, Enron,
Chevron. Do you think it is possible? Again, nothing of a competitive
nature has to be offered, they just are trying to determine what they ought
to be doing with respect to IT.

Thanks in advance.

Louise,

I think what I really wanted to convey is the following:

1. John Grass originally headed up the Wellhead desk and Outsourcing efforts for the producer segment.  I wanted him to do that because of the logistics overlap between purchasing wellhead gas and offering outsourcing services.

2. When the volume of the Wellhead desk started to increase and based on my frustation with the lack of ""contract focus"" with Ocean Energy, Andex, and other producer outsourcing deals being pursued, I asked Kevin Miller to manage Producer Outsourcing and John Grass to manage only the Wellhead desk.

3. Based on Kevin Miller's memo (attached below), the Wellhead desk reporting into Hunter, I have been questioning the value of a separate outsourcing effort independent of the Wellhead desk.

When I was working on the VOD team at EBS, we talked with so many companies (as did other groups within EBS).  It was handy to know who was tied to us with a conf. agreement.  I thought it might be helpful here too.

You need to change the definition of Transaction in the first WHEREAS clause and then you can send it.

I could put together a list we have copies of them in the legal dept.  What do you want to use the list for??

Lee,

I made the changes to the Duke confidentiality agreement that you sent me, basically just the name changes.  Is there anything else I need to do, or can I just print this out and send it to them?  Please let me know.

Also,  Is there a list of companies that have a confientiality agreement with Transwestern?

	My name is Chris Weekley and I am David and Bonnie Weekley's son.   I am

recently had out of town plans fall through and this is why I am beginning
this process seemingly late.  I am a junior at Vanderbilt University and I am

Effectiveness.  This major studies organizations and the human interactions
that allow them to effectively operate.  I have taken various courses in
organizational theory, economics and human relations.   I think it would be a
great opportunity for me to gain experience within Enron.  I would be more

Steve,


I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.









As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
                    This creates a shortage in later months.

 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  
                      Specific questions should include:  

  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system.  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.

 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted.  


Call me if you need any more input.

I enjoyed meeting you last week to discuss my application to join your group. 
Please keep my inquiry confidential for now.

If selected, I think your group would greatly benefit from my diverse 
skill-set including modeling skills utilizing Excel, Access, and
Bloomberg as well as graphing, statistical, and other quantitative abilities, 
especially in the meteorology field.

I am particularly interested in being able to discover vital information 
which may affect the markets (e.g. pulp/paper, interest rates, weather) as 
well as arriving at a new variable which captures all market variables into 
one which may be followed and forecasted for each of the groups.

Furthermore, I am truly committed to adding value to your group, including 
making significant contributions,
and am sanguine about my ability to ensure that these achievements are 
well-received.

I have met many people at Enron thus far and am able to utilize these 
strategic alliances by knowing who may be able
to assist your group in the quest for information on different projects. By 
accessing information quickly, both internal and 
external to the firm, the group would be able to extraordinarily benefit from 
this diligence  In addition, by seeking greater efficiencies in my work, 
I have been able to be instrumental in accumulating additional 
responsibilities. 

Most importantly, I have the mathematical acumen and insight to ensure the 
continued growth and prosperity of your group.

My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a 
sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only 
require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I 
would net around $20K cash.  

You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or 
higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the 
New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.

Brown won 43% of the vote (to Sanchez' 40%) and is now in a run off with Sanchez.  Sue Walden's perspective, not surprisingly, is that Brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters.  African American turnout in the election was lower than expected, but an active get-out-the-vote campaign could turn that around.
Enron has supported the mayor with a $10,000 contribution.  I would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances.
If you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration, you could:
Congratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition.
Compliment him on how he has responded to security issues since Sept 11 and his handling of flood relief.
(You should know that the Houston police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the October 26 threat to the Enron building.)
We have responded to the City's RFP for energy service.
EES made a presentation last week proposing a 5-7 year transaction
The city is opting for a 1-2 year transaction
That would require very detailed load data which is in Reliant's possession.
We have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the city's effort to do a deal with Reliant.  We have said that we won't play on those terms.
Separately, we are working with the city on a demand side deal."	violation detected	This text contains a variety of sensitive information, including political campaign details, financial contributions, interactions with law enforcement, and business negotiations.

1283	"Hey guys.  Let's try this.  Take the data from 2000 and change the 
following.  Take Keystone West volumes to 850,000/d rateably, then add the 
new gen numbers posted below.  You will need to add this demand to the EOC S 
ML demand numbers (Is Salmayuca included in this number?).  We should use the 
2000 waha west volumes for now.  You should end up with reduced ehrenberg 
volumes for the reduction in Keystone west volumes and the addition of New 
Gen demand.  Run the storage balance at 2000 Socal in this scenario.  We will 
then plug forward with waha west volumes to balance Socal in 2001.  Also, add 
columns to adjust (90%, 60%, 50%, etc) the burns for new gen in SW.  We 
should then look to adjusting socal demand down for the high hydro/increased 
NW imports to CA scenario that could happen.  Use the SP-15 2000 gen numbers 
and then back out the avg of 1999 and 2000 power imports.  I would like to 
avoid averaging 1999 and 2000 socal gas demand. Use a 10,000 heat rate to 
reduce gas demand.  Have Jay adjust EOC demand for normal weather.  We may 
have to refer to the load sensitivity data from west power to reduce the SW 
electric loads and then back out of gen numbers using a 10,000 heat rate.  We 
will then be exposed to EPNG and the OPS increasing Keystone west volumes 
between now and next summer - run the 2001 with this possibility as well.  
Take Key West to 1.1 bcf.  Let me know where my errors in approach may be.

This should give us a picture of the Socal deliverability for 2001.

Subject: Flag Football Schedule

Heat,

I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our 
esteemed Enron Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to
tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first 
game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably 
wouldn't
have won anyway.  

Here is the schedule.  Enron's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this 
means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.
Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the 
location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are
below.  Sorry about the confusion this week, but I'll see you on the field 
next Wednesday night.

Brian

Well, the folks are fine.  But, they have a few friends who lost just about 
everthing.  In fact, one family found only a couple of boxes of salvagable(?) 
items from their home (only one family picture) .  I understand that alot of 
homes were reduced to rubble with very little left to save.  It was very 
bad.  What made it worse was the freezing weather coming in.  When we talked 
to Tonya's parents, they were really in shock of bad it was.

 Have you been battling those Christmas mobs?  I took friday and Monday off 
and tried my luck at it.  I didn't last too long.  It doesn't seem right to 
be cussing everyone out at Christmas...I think I hate people now...I think 
I'm becoming a scrooge.   Well, I hope ya'll are doing good and staying in 
the Christmas mood.  Cole is excited about Christmas (wants more Hot Wheels 
and monster trucks).  Jake doesn't have the foggiest idea what's going on 
except that he wants to rip every ornament off of the tree and eat it.  We've 
told him ""no"" so much that he shakes his head back and forth and smiles while 
he's grabbing for one.  He is a handful.  Jake has also started taking 
steps.  He just turned 9 months old this month.  That's a little over a month 
earlier than Cole started taking steps.  

Anyway, I need to go.

 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 

 For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to ""sponsor"" every child in that school.  What we mean by ""sponsor"" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.

I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!

If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to ""sponsor"" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. 

All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.

Thanks for your support!!

I was wondering if the Bammel lease to AEP contains any operating parameters to protect the integrity of the facility.  The question arises from the fact that Bammel  had about 24 BCF of remaining capacity when Enron turned the facility over to AEP.  We believe their plan is to max inject in June which would reduce the remaining capacity to around 12 BCF.  It could become a challenge to keep injections under the remaining 12 BCF level during the reaming 4-5 months of the injection cycle.  Enron always operated the facility with the understanding that a Gas In Place volume greater than 117.5 BCF could create a high enough pressure to jeopardize the safety of the wellhead casings and some of the abandoned wells.  We would not want the Texas RRC to question the safety of the Bammel facility.  From the other end of the perspective if the Gas In Place is taken below 65 BCF their is a high probability of watering out the outer wells and the facility itself."	violation detected	This text contains proprietary business information and technical details about the operation of a facility, including specific capacity levels, operational parameters, and safety concerns, which should not be publicly disclosed.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Maureen McGee"	violation detected	This text contains explicit personal information such as full name, email address, and physical address, as well as financial information related to Enron stock transactions and donations, all of which can lead to privacy risks and potential misuse.

John

We are pleased to confirm today's launch of the following products via EOL:

Ethylene Contract (NW Europe)
Propylene Contract (NW Europe)
HD Polyethylene (German Film)
Polypropylene (German Inj)
Polystyrene (German General Purpose)

In a 2nd roll-out (timing TBC) we are looking to add:

PVC (German Pipe)
LD Polyethylene (German Film)
LLD Polyethylene (German C4)

We are initially offering 6 month and 12 month swaps for each product.

SUMMATION OF EUROPEAN MKT

- market is very conservative and tunnel-visioned, with derivatives as very 
new concept to all players (case of tail trying to wag the dog)

- even though no OTC trades have been done we are looking for the launch to 
act as a magnet for potential counterparties to at least start looking at our 
numbers on a regular basis (personalised letters + PR in industry mags is 
underway).

- Shell / BP are talking of launching similar platform 2001, but Enron only 
company aggressively marketing in Europe (look at 
http://www.eyeforchemicals.com/chem/presentations/hurley.pdf for Shell 
perspective).

- Enron brand is not known to converters/consumers  - profile awareness / 
promotion is continuous process.

- 6mo and 12mo prices are offered, as shorter term we are exposed due to the 
fact we are not in physical mkt.

- spreads are reasonably aggressive, but for hedging purposes all products 
show close correlation to each other and US equivalents.

Susan,

There was a small amount of gas sold from the Kahuna Gas plant in October.
I have spoken with Joe Casa with Enron and he is going to provide volumes.
Can you please provide me the October pricing or give me the name of
someone who can?

Thanks,

* We initiate coverage of Aquila, Inc. with a 1H (Buy, High Risk)
rating and a 12-month price target of $44.
* Aquila is a pure-play Energy Merchant, leveraging their strong
trading and risk management skills in the rapidly growing energy commodity
markets.  Aquila was an early mover into these deregulating markets, and has
shown strong traction over recent years, which we believe is sustainable
long-term.
* We project a 20-25% growth rate for ILA driven by our robust outlook

commodities and geographies.
* At a 2002 0.7x P/E-to-growth (PEG) ratio, ILA is trading at a
significant discount to their Energy Merchant peer average of 1.0x. Based on
its strong track record and potential for industry-leading earnings growth,
we place a PEG value on ILA of 1.0x 2002 earnings, leading to our $44 price
target.

Hi Fran,

 

I know you must be really bogged down with  questions, so my apologies in advance for bugging you, but if you could track  down an answer for me it would be much appreciated.  

 

I am running the Houston Marathon for the Leukemia  Society.  I made a fundraising commitment of $2000.  I have raised  $1000 and have been waiting for the Enron match of $1000 from the matching gifts  program.  The request was submitted well in advance of the cutoff  deadline that was announced via e-mail a few weeks before the layoffs.  The  Leukemia Society has not yet received the match.  If Enron does not come up  with the match, I am personally on the hook for this $1000, and in light of the  small severance situation, it is going to be really tough for me right  now.

 

Do you have any information on whether or not  the Enron commitment will be honored as was communicated in the  e-mail?  Do you have any idea when the funds will be sent to the  Leukemia Society?  Any information you can provide right now will be much  appreciated, so that I can pass it along to the Leukemia  Society.  

 

Thank you,

 

Elizabeth Hutchinson

1359	"Greg and John,

I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of 
trades ( keeping the 
total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable.  This is partially 
because in a trending market
we lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose 
market move from
$30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL, we take 6 trades of short 
positions, the total MTM for that
day is (-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$90,000 and total trading volume is 60,000 BBL.
 If per trade volume is 60,000 BBL, we take one trade, the total MTM is 
-5*60,000= -$300,000.

Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the 
number of trades, we can be more
profitable as a market maker.  

I rerun a scenario that Stinson sent to you on Dec. 27 where he used per 
trade volume of 30,000 BBL.
I reduce the number of trade to 10,000 while increasing the number of trades 
by 3.  Almost in all
cases, I saw increased profitability.  See the colume marked ""Change"" for 
dollar amount change.

Please let Stinson or me know your thoughts on this.

Regards,

Zimin Lu

In our continuous commitment to enhance the services we offer
you, Factiva is proud to announce the expanded availability of
the Financial Times (FT).

Commencing June 16, the full text from all editions of the FT,
including FT.com, will be accessible to all Publications Library
and CustomClips customers.  The FT will continue to be
unavailable in Business Newsstand. The rollout of the full text of
the FT complements Factiva's compelling content set of top must-read
global business sources including The Wall Street Journal and
Dow Jones, Reuters and AP Newswires. In addition, this unique
source combination will be offered at launch in Factiva.com, our
new flagship product.

The full text will replace the FT Abstracts. In order to provide
you with uninterrupted coverage, the full text of all articles
from June 1 on will be made available. The FT abstract archive
to date will continue to be accessible to you as well.

This change will require no action on your part. The full text of
the FT will have the same source codes that were previously applied
to the FT Abstracts. This means your CustomClips folders and saved
searches will automatically get this expanded content - and it will
be available on day of publication to provide you with the most
up-to-date global business information.

If you have any questions, please contact your account executive.

Hey Darron,

What's going on??  Just wanted to say thanks for inviting me to go out on
the boat last weekend.  Hope I was not rude when we were leaving, but I
really started to feel like crap.  When we got back to Scott's I almost
puked a couple times and was stuck on the crapper for some time.  I ended up
not going to work on Monday and half of Tuesday because of the hebee jebees.
Anyway, if you ever need anyone to help you with the boat when you go out
(uh, yeah), give me a call and I would be glad to 'help' out.

speaking to the group, and Jim McNulty with Parsons immediately recognized 
Ken and wants him to speak about the ""big energy picture,"" given Enron's

 May 16 - Phil Angelides
 June 19 - John Bryson
 July 11 - Steve Ledbetter
 July 26 - Loretta Lynch

You may want to attend these luncheons just to see what  these four have to 
say.  I've asked if Warren Olney could do the interview w/ Ken, and Adrian 
Medawar said she'd call him.

Great job lining this one up -- thank you!

huge deal, in fact the agreed upon close timing was a major consideration in 
getting agreement within GPG to go forward as it was an improvement that we

Subject: Risk Document Information


I think Steve was planning to add my comments on impact of prolonging GPG 
close to the risk document, but  I did not see it in the document I edited 
yesterday.  To restate, it needs to be noted under org impact that GPG's 
close is going from 5 to 8+ days which is unacceptable.  We have the 
impression that there is not sufficient desire/potential across the BUs to do 
what is necessary to get it down to the committed 3 days that we all agreed 
to at the ASE.  We view this as a showstopper and will hold the  project and 
COE and our own team accountable for meeting that committment by the end of 
the year if not sooner.  It seems like we should already have a plan in place 
on how we are going to achieve that.  This was a design signoff exception too.

Also, info for risk document below.  My question below was taken from the 
risk doc and responded to for actions that have been taken..

If you can, please update for these two items before next distribution

Attached is a generic spreadsheet that lists environmental activities and 
approvals for power projects.  I have divided it into three different sheets 
that represent:  1) activities/permits required prior to construction, 2) 
activities/permits after start of construction and prior to commercial 
operation, and 3) activities/permits after start of commercial operation. 

I see it being a worthwhile effort to produce a separate list for each 
project, including schedule milestones and responsible parties.  Whether each 
list is generated by me, an environmental consultant, legal counsel, the 
developer, etc. is something we should decide on a project by project basis.  
I would appreciate your comments on this.

By the way, I don't consider this generic spreadsheet to contain an 
exhaustive list of possible permits.  There are a number of other potential 
approvals, such as occupancy permit, driveway permit, environmental resource 
permit, etc. that aren't on this spreadsheet.  We really need to assess each 
project individually.

Jerry as mentioned a couple of weeks ago, we are still investigating the vibration issue on the compressor end of unit #26 at Mullinville.  To bring everybody up to speed (no pun intended) we have Hickham Industries scheduled to be on site WEdnesday and Thursday this week to continue the analysis.  My hope is to have a plan of attack this Friday, that will give us some timelines to shoot for.

As of today the outage I believe has been extended to the end of this month, and pending our analysis results it may have to be extended for a couple of more weeks.  Jerry, I will keep you informed if you can keep everyone else informed within Gas Control, Planning and System Optimization.

     On the ""yeses"", please let me know who you would like to follow up on 
and encourage to accept.  We will try to do this by volunteers: more than one 
per student is OK, and each of you should select one or two. When you talk to 
them, get their feedback on Super Saturday and the whole process. If anyone 
wants to call any of the ""no's"", to commisserate, that's OK too. - - -DLH

1410	"Yesterday, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved VA/HUD/Independent 
Agencies appropriations bill (which funds EPA) and included legislative 
language stating that EPA should harmonize the NOx SIP and 126 deadlines for 
SIP submission and compliance.   As you may recall, under the NOx SIP Call 
the courts have required states to submit SIPs to EPA by October 31, 2000, 
and recently moved the deadline for sources to comply with the state plans to 
May 2004.   While the Section 126 rule will be litigated this fall, the 
courts have not moved the deadline for sources to comply with this federal 
NOx regulation from May of 2003.

Industry supporters of this language are optimistic that this legislative 
language increases the chances that the SIP Call and 126 rules will be 
harmonized.  If the language passes, it will have the force of law -- 
depending on how forceful the final language is, EPA may be compelled to 
harmonize the laws.  On the other hand, this also increases the visibility of 
the language and could increase opposition to its inclusion in the 
appropriations bill as the House/Senate Conference Committee considers the 
bill.  The language was not in the House version of the bill, and the 
Administration could weigh in with a veto threat that could scare off Senate 
negotiators in the end.

This would be a significant development in NOx regulation, in that if this 
language becomes law, we would have more certainty that generation sources 
would not likely need to comply with NOx regulations until May 2004.  Right 
now, industry still faces a May 2003 deadline for compliance with the 126 
petitions, unless the litigation or this legislation changes things.

We will keep you posted as developments occur."	no violation detected

Here is the FERC Order on California issues.

Along with this Order, the question has been raised whether or not this Order 
effectively tells the CPUC that they have no authority in wholesale matters 
and we will not give them the information they are requesting in their

1430	"Attached is the starting point for our discussion tomorrow morning.  A few things to keep in the back of your mind as you look at this:  

(1)	We don't think we're going to end up with a settlement in this case.  So, we need to design our presentation to include the evidence necessary for the OPUC to rule in our favor.  The rate plan is a complete plan because we need to present a showing of benefits to get the transaction approved.

(2)	PGE and NWN already have in place mechanisms that will automatically pass through the benefits of any savings in (a) generation costs--even if its A&G that gets allocated to generation; and (b) gas costs.  If we do nothing with respect to these cost categories, we will face a fight to keep the synergies every year.  

(3)	The proposal has a number of bells & whistles.  We may want to think of the proposal as a menu of ""rate benefits"" we can offer.  Take one from column A and one from column B, etc.

 Years 4 &5 500 hours per year

Is this profile consistent with the pricing request we discussed with Charlie

for each of you.  Therefore, if you have no exceptions you just need to type 
in 
your name in the bottom right corner by the place marked (Emp Sign), and save 
it.

If you do have exception time, simply open that particular pay period and 
show the exception time (off-duty,vacation, overtime, sick time, jury time, 
family 
time, etc.) that you may have had during that pay period.  Some of the codes 
have already been entered for you, the rest are listed at the bottom of the 
spreadsheet and just change the ones that are already there for whatever 
applies.  

If you are an exempt employee you need only show your off-duty time 
or exception time.  If you are non-exempt you must show all hours worked 
and if you have overtime, you must add that to the 8 hours regular time.  
There is no code for non-exempt overtime.

This should make it much easier for everyone.  However, I will need you to
fill out this timesheet form by the 13th and 29th of each month.  I will
try and remind you by email the day before.

I would still appreciate your emailing me of any vacation, HOD day, or any 
other 
off-duty that you know about before hand, that way if you are out of pocket 
for any 
reason and cannot fill in one of the forms,  I will be able to fill in your 
timesheet for you.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know.

Thanks!

isn't going to supply the EFM at their new location.  Given that they have 
yet to contribute the funds requested for our efforts, I don't think we 
should spend the money to put measurement out there until they send us the 
$10,000.  Maybe we should ammend the interconnect agreement to change the 
estimate back to the $30,000 we originally requested.

his impression was that progress was being made.  He also had no problem with 
either NERC or GISB participation and felt that NERC has been fairly 
sympathetic to NASUCA.  With respect to some of the consumer issues, there is 
a fear that a national standard will weaken gains made in individual states 
that are more progressive than the national standard might be.  Finally, he 
suggested that a list be made of the technical versus policy (Consumer) 
issues so that we can at least try and move on the technical issues.  I 
suggested that I would have you call to clarify the details on the issues 
that Enron believes are not being addressed fast enough.  Overall, I would 
characterize Larry as very supportive of getting things done quickly, but 
concerned about protecting the consumer interests in the process.  (Right of

July 17 departure, 7 day cruise                            June 18, 7 day
cruise

$1499/per person, inside room                              $1300/person,
inside room
$1699/per person, ocean view                               $1599/person,
ocean room

Leave out of Vancouver, visit Hubbard Glacier, Skagway, Haines, Misty fjords,
Inside passage, Ketchikan, Juneau.  New ship( built in 1997) 2200 passengers,
 large glassed in area to view scenery/wildlife.

For an extra approximately $900/person, you can add a 3 day land package
which is basically a visit to McKinley and Denali, and probably Fairbanks.
Representative said as long as you are all the way up there, you should go
see the wildlife.

Carnival Cruises goes too but this cruise sounded more suited to mom and dad.
According to the rep, more elegant, good food, etc.

I have a courtesy reservation for the July cruise (figuring it might be
warmer, though she said that June and July are warmest) I got the ocean view
room.

I don't know 1-800 CRUISES   from Adam.  I will try and call my travel agent
tomorrow just to see what she says about Royal Caribbean.

If we do the July cruise and land package, it is $4998 (air fare, cruise,
port costs) for mom and dad which comes to $1300 for each one of us.

I leave Saturday for a week so I'd appreciate some feedback before I go if
possible (not necessarily a commitment, just feedback).  I think they have
this hold for a few days though I don't necessarily think we have to decide
immediately.  If we want to do this, there is a $300/person deposit (didn't
ask if it is refundable or not), with the balance due 75 days before
departure.

What do you think?

What about suggesting Friday, September 7 for the Santa Fe, Prediction Co, trip?

We could go to Stanford on Thursday, the day before. 

Also, they want to speak about the agenda and the NDA. Can you ask Greg if
he wants to participate in the conference call? I want to propose Friday, 2:00 p.m. our time, for

Cornhusker transaction. When Dan was in my office several weeks ago, we spoke 
with you and it appeared that some of the financial terms of the gas

know the details of the extension on the transition agreement? Are you

Subject:	 Gas flow and prepayment schedule through 3/28/02


I have requested the following payments to made to Reliant on Thur, 3/28/02.

 Prepay to Reliant for April Trunkline deal (sitara #1202698)   6,800 dth x 30 days x $3.44 per dth = $701,760.00
This item is NOT included on my worksheet.  I did this deal with Jim Taylor yesterday.

Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline $40,000.00 (normal weekly prepay).
Prepay to Reliant for possible intraday supply on Florida (volume up to 10,000 dth per day) $70,000.00.

I have combined the $40,000 and $70,000 on my worksheet but I'm not sure how my cash department will wire the funds.  As of today, ENA has not purchased any swing supply on Trunkline Reliant and I do not anticipate very much activity on this deal.

Please let me know if anyone has questions.

Thanks

P.S.  Jim, according to Tallahassee, on February 27th that they requested 2,000 dth and they only received 1,550 dth.  Would you have someone in your shop verify that before I make an adjustment to the worksheet please.

1508	"For our New York workshop, I would like to put some ""meat"" on my very
intellectual (HaHa) discussion of the Cover Sheet.  Specifically, I would
like to go through some examples of how the Cover Sheet can be filled out,
i.e., focus on some credit hypotheticals and provide examples of the type
of things that you can add to the Cover Sheet, i.e., arbitration, choice of
venue, waiver of jury trial, language regarding transactions performed in
the WSPP or ERCOT control areas, etc.

     If you have already drafted any provisions to add to the Cover Sheet
or have any ideas for hypotheticals, I'd appreciate your input.  If you are
planning on adding standard provisions to all your EEI Cover Sheets, this
would be an excellent opportunity to allow me to ""market"" them for you and
explain their need/purpose/applicability.

     Also, I don't suppose anyone has come up with a Gas Schedule to the
EEI Agreement???  Just an idea which I'm not opposed to and which would
lead us in the direction Mark and Chris seemed to be pointing, i.e., a
Master Physical Agreement applicable to numerous types commodities.
Considering GISB is intending to revise its current form for short term
transactions and create a new form for long term transactions, this would
be an excellent opportunity to allow GISB and EEI to work with (and not
against) each other.

     If you, or your company, is not currently on the drafting committee
for GISB's proposed revisions and creation of a new form for long term
transactions (which, by the way, is an important point I want to make to
the GISB group that we do not want two separate forms, one for short and
one for long in the first place), I encourage you to contact GISB @
GISB1@aol.com and get involved.

     Please let me know your thoughts.

     Thanks.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

1534	"Endurance, Encouragement, Hope and Bring Home Good
Fruit

I heard these words today in our Homily at church.
They seemed to jump out at me with the current
situation we have all been faced with at Enron.

You have endured through a tremendous storm.  Although
your colleagues have disappeared leaving you to hold
the bag, although you are at the center of intense
criticism and accusations from investors, shareholders
and employees and although the media has been brutal,
you have endured.  Your endurance, I believe, gives us
the endurance, the encouragement and the hope that
Enron will stabilize and be as strong as it ever was
and with a much stronger foundation.  Turmoil serves
only to strengthen and bring a community together.  It
was true on September 11th and it can be true at
Enron.  We have been shaken, but we cannot give up.
With hope anything is possible.

Enron has been my home for 20 years.  I was there when
we became Enron.  The last week was extremely
difficult for all, ""the straw that broke the camels
back"" for me was when I came in to workout on Friday
morning at 5:30 a.m. and the Body Shop was closed.  A
note on the front door, ""the Body Shop would be
shutting down at 7:30 p.m. Thursday evening"".  I had
been so strong up to this point.  After I found a
place to shower, I cried for two hours.  A culmination
of events finally broke me.  I had been so optimistic.
 I am blessed ""for the moment"", I still have a job.  I
believe I would be blessed even if I didn't have a
job.

I have not given up.  As long as we have you and ""you
can endure"", I know we will all make it through this
storm.

May God Bless You

John,

You or Greg need to address the various groups with whatever generic information you can as to where we are in the process, expected timeline, hurdles before start up again, starting VAR and general organizational structure.  People are moving from frustration to feeling insulted that they are expected to sit still with no information.  I know you have a lot on your plate but if we really want people to hang in there a little longer before we address each individual's situation they need some sense of when they can expect closure.

I have recently seen a new Navajo Nation document concerning a ROW which

jurisdiction.

Perhaps it would save time for Steve if we simply had a provision in the ROW

this ROW. All ambiguities shall be resolved in favor of the Bloxham

1) Despite promises to the contrary--common theme in this exercise--Burton 
(as I understand) did not remove the condemnation (expropriation?) language 
from ABx6, i.e., the state can just take your power plant (or anything else, 
it seems), if it has the inkling.  That's an egregious provision in ABx6.

2) I don't recall trying to amend ABx18 to say, ""pay them their PX credits.""  
I understood the tactic to be--get a prospective, date certain end to the 
freeze in the bill, which then gives us very firm legal ground on which to 
seek and get the money owed to us.  We could seek the additional language, 
but if putting date certain does the same thing without attracting a lot of 
attention, may be a preferable path.

3) Forgive me if I've just overlooked it, but I got wind of a bill by Ms 
Migden (ABx8?)  that gives one whole heckuvalot of new power--power usually 
left to FERC--to the CA Electricity Oversight Board.  Anyone know about it?  
We may want to get details for inclusion in the discussion with Delainey.

Banking side) about the need to set up an account at Bear Stearns for JEDI I 
to execute the sale of the Quicksilver Shares.  I explained that the 
operations people are reluctant to establish an account if there is little 
activity anticipated.  In the case of this JEDI I account, the only 
transaction this will take place is the SALE of the Quicksilver shares, there 
will be no further activity.  In fact, we will probably be closing the 
account soon after the trade is settled.  He is very much aware of the 
situation and is going to contact the appropriate people in Chicago to 
instruct them to be fully cooperative with Enron in establishing this 
account.  

I realize this is a huge inconvenience to have to set up an account for this 
one trade, but given the negotiations with the company and Bear Stearns, it 
is the best thing to do.  If anybody has any questions, please let me know.

Sharad's investigations of Exotica's status in London have turned up a very 
confused state of affairs. This isn't being helped by the fact that:
1. Anjam is rarely at his desk, and can't be found anywhere in the building.
2. When he is around he isn't willing or able to provide all the information 
Sharad might need to support Exotica.  
This is worrying since much of our business depends on the validity of 
Exotica's valuations.

Sharad will now request information from Anjam via email to leave a trail, 
and I want to alert you to the fact that Sharad will be cc'ing you in on 
these emails.  

If things don't improve soon, I may need to request some assistance in

1585	"I just came across this morning to some additional information from the 
regulator (CNE) regarding their motivations on its Arcos TPA ruling: 

1) Despite the current regulatory gaps, Enron's allegations were properly 
crafted, and made possible a way forward within the existing legal framework. 
The ""two-sides commitment"" idea suggested by Enron has been quite determinant 
because...

2) ... the resolution fundamentally aims at making sure that the power plant 
is actually built (Enron finally commits), but also that new gas 
infrastructures start being developed asap!! There is clearly an underlying 
energy policy issue here, and this reasoning fits with the tight timescales 
imposed by the CNE to ratify our interest and signing the TPA contract. The 
resolution is seen by the CNE as a catalyser to put in track gas expansions 
and power plant investments.

Note that the CNE (and the Ministry) are testing if Enron is ""truly"" 
committed to put the money and invest by placing us in a no-return point 
(mine).

Please, find below a full English translation of the CNE's ruling.

Caroline,
As I have said from the outset, before we send them an ISDA, we need to 
obtain from their Bermuda counsel a legal opinion that gives us the 
assurances that we need that (1) all of the Bermuda transactions have been 
duly authorized and are enforceable by us against AIG and (2) we have a 
perfected security interest in any collateral that has been posted by AIG to 
us.  A form of the legal opinion is attached to the confirm.  As to point #1, 
we have no way of confirming this on our own and I understand from Brent 
Hendry that because of various peculiarities with Bermuda law, our only way 
of gaining comfort on this is through the legal opinion process.  As to point 
#2, we have gotten some comfort from our legal counsel on this but again it 
is appropriate to have AIG's counsel opine as to this.

Please call or e-mail me, Sara or Frank if you have any additional questions.
